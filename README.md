# John Hopkins University Data Science Specialization Capstone Project: NLP

This was the 10th and final module of the Data Science Specialization offered through Coursera.

The assignment was to create an app to predict the next word of a string entered by a user.

There are 2 milestone reports and a final presentation with a link to the app.

NPL was not covered in the previous courses, so this was a challenging project. We had to read up on NLP AND develop the app within 7 weeks. 
Sink or swim. The way I like it.
