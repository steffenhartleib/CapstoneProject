# John Hopkins University Data Science Specialization Capstone Project: NLP

This was the 10th and final module of the Data Science Specialization offered through Coursera.<br/>
<br/>
The assignment was to create an app to predict the next word of a string entered by a user.<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 milestone reports and a final presentation with a link to the app.<br/>
<br/>
NPL was not covered in the previous courses, so this was a challenging project. We had to read up on NLP AND develop the app within 7 weeks. <br/>
<br/>
Sink or swim. The way I like it.<br/k >
