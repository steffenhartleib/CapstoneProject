(Next year the lifetime break is scheduled to drop to $1 million and the top rate to rise to 55%.)

The first is the love of self and the second, the love of money. Two Greek words, philautos and philargyros, succinctly express these concepts. Both, I detect, lie at the root of the world's problems. Certainly, this diagnosis is not novel. Why then are these destructive personality traits chronic in the human experience? Further, why are people who possess these attributes permitted to run rampant through communities and societies to the detriment of the greater population? The Protester seeks to curb the second phenomenon.

Though Maryland is the wealthiest state in the country, all Maryland's children are not equal. Maryland is not exempt from the conditions that allowed the Trayvon Martin tragedy to occur. Our battle for equity for all of our children is not just against individuals, it is against established systems and institutions. Child-wellbeing indicators show disparities from infancy to adulthood. See Advocates for Children and Youth at http://www.acy.org for more information. There are health disparities in infant mortality and low-birthweight babies. There are educational disparities in academic achievement and disparate administering of school discipline policies such as suspensions, expulsions, and school-based arrests. There are child welfare system disparities that show children of color being removed from home at higher rates than their white counterparts. There are juvenile justice system disparities at every stage from arrest to placement to youth being tried as adults.

It also doesn't report the wounding of troops who were attacked alongside those who were killed.

Then comes the defense, which has played outstanding all season and deserves much credit for those gaudy goalie stats. And not only do they protect the net, they produce.

Questionable Calls: Wilson was a major reach at the 48th overall selection as a safety with suspect range who wasn't much of a ball-hawk at Illinois.

A: I think it was absolutely right. What happened with King Crimson is that Ian McDonald and Mike Giles decided that they didn't want to go touring anymore. They decided they just wanted to make records in the studio. And so, they left King Crimson. That was it. The band was over. Now, we could have replaced two people, but I just didn't feel it was right. Ian and Mike were so important in that band. I said to Robert (Fripp) at the time, "I'll form a new band if you like. But I just don't feel right about carrying on the name King Crimson.
In accusing Adams of failing to live up to his commitment, Cogen cites a letter Adams sent in May 2009 to then-County Chairman Ted Wheeler.

Eurama cautions her against prizing the fabric over the person, a lesson that doesn't quite land, even when McKinley is swept into mourning at an indigo-tinged funeral when Eurama's husband dies. After this, McKinley continues to collect in weighty encounters successive fabrics, traveling along roads and through outposts that she notes were built for imperial extraction. McKinley's description of indigo's history, which often arises as overly deliberate exposition, is best when it appears like this, as it is — underfoot, in the air. Her most difficult procurement comes in the middle of an attempted coup in the Ivory Coast, where she sees herself mirrored in an upper-class African woman carrying, amid chaos over control of wealth, a Chanel purse: "I'm just like her; I'm unable to give up the ghost of the things I hope will fill me with meaning."

TRENTON — A city resident convicted of sexually assaulting his girlfriend’s two little girls was sentenced to 34 years in prison Thursday.
Santorum didn’t. He overthought. He overcorrected. He overdid. He spent so much time explaining the process by which he voted for this, or why he’d originally done that, and the difficulty in his position that led him to do the other, that he never made a positive case for himself.
For the rest of the runners, though, the race was a chance to dress up, join with thousands of friends, old and new, and spend a morning of revelry sweating shoulder-to-shoulder on the city pavement.

Mr. Malouf, who is on his third heart (his first transplant was in 1989 and what he hopes was his last in 2003), says more changes at Petersham are likely; he is working with existing kitchen staff and wants to hire people who are at least as good or better than he is to get through the transition.

But what's most amazing about "American Reunion" is its absolute lack of tonal control.

"The fact is," says Yuval Levin of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, "Medicare is going to crush the government, and if Republicans leave it unreformed then the debt picture is very, very ugly. They might never -- literally never -- show the budget reaching balance. Not in the 10-year window and not if they take their graphs out 100 years. Obama could probably show balance just past the budget window in the middle of the next decade because of the massive Medicare cuts he proposes, even if in practice they will never actually happen."

The same, of course, could be said of narrative, which is, at the most basic level, an attempt to impose order on the chaos of experience. That adds another layer of tension to the collection, since stories need some kind of resolution even when what they record is unresolved. For the most part, Doerr does an excellent job of balancing these intentions, creating work that is open-ended yet nuanced, avoiding false connections or epiphanies. The narrator of "The River Nemunas," a teenage girl who moves from Kansas to Lithuania to live with her grandfather after her parents die of cancer, learns that it never gets easier, that the pain of absence is perhaps the only thing that doesn't dissipate. "Lots of things fade away," she thinks, "but ghosts like these don't, heartbreak like this doesn't."

Strangely, the shift in the tight game came courtesy of two huge three-pointers by Holiday in the fourth quarter. With the Sixers leading, 74-73, and Holiday having made only six of 21 shots, the third-year guard rose from 27 feet with the confidence he always seems to have.

Like the two previous films about the CGI rodents with the helium singing voices, "Chipwrecked" falls well short of the bar for wink-wink postmodernism set by "Shrek." But it does make surprisingly inoffensive viewing for adults, who will find the semi-sly references to Sarah Palin and "You Got Served" a welcome distraction from the hackneyed plot, which sees the three Chipmunks and their girl-group counterparts, the Chipettes, marooned on a desert island complete with active volcano, hidden treasure and a savage native (a snarling honey badger).

With Ruvo as their host, Cosgrove, along with his wife, Anita, and a handful of other Clinic executives, found themselves as welcomed members of the Las Vegas scene at this year's gala -- it's a scene that Cosgrove succinctly summed up during the charity auction by saying, "It's not Cleveland, is it?"

When it works, though, it is a sight to behold. The Americans looked like a cat toying with a mouse for much of the first half of the final, reeling defenders in only to make the ball disappear with a deft flick or smooth pass to a teammate.

Asked whether he felt his team was ready for the game, Jones said: "I'd never say that I don't think anybody is ever not ready for a game. Everybody has their own style on how they play, and if they get ready or not. We just have to come out with more fire, especially in day games. I know we're all tired, probably didn't get that much sleep. The same goes for them. You have to come out ready to play and try to get yourself real hyped three hours before the game.

Detectives began re-interviewing witnesses after receiving a Jan. 4 Sun-Times request for all reports on the case.

When you look at the internal data on international tests you find a telling dichotomy regarding American scores. America has a disproportional number of students doing very, very well and a large portion doing poorly. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which administers the PISA test, explains this dichotomy: the number of children in poverty. Twenty-two percent of American children live in mind-numbing poverty, which is far greater than the next highest country. Children do not learn well when they are hungry.

As New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees continues to close in on Dan Marino's single-season passing record, he is carrying his entire team along with him. Brees threw for 412 yards and five touchdowns Sunday in a 42-20 win over Minnesota, leading the Saints to their sixth win in a row. New Orleans had to overcome a sloppy start against Minnesota, including turning the ball over twice deep in its own territory in the first half, botching a surprise onside kick and having a 40-yard TD pass called back because of a penalty. But it mattered little to Brees and the red-hot Saints. Brees now has 4,780 passing yards this season, putting him 304 away from Marino's single-season record of 5,084 yards that he set in 1984. With two games to play, that leaves Brees needing to average just over 150 yards per game. It's hard to imagine Marino's record won't fall.

We also prosecuted the deadliest home arson in Cleveland history under a law that relied partially on the federal Section 8 housing program. Rightfully, the community expected us to use these federal tools to help in those cases.

If you use charcoal, you can arrange the coals in a few different ways. Light your coals as usual.

I’ve been fortunate to cover a few hospital stories over the past year with the Chicago Tribune. While it may sound like an emotionally wrenching assignment, I use the word "fortunate" because I feel that it’s an honor telling the stories of patients going through such hardships.

Linda Wilson: You are right that the left of the two left turn lanes is a continuous flow for traffic to eastbound Manchester. Really the only people that should be stopping in the right left turn lane are those want to cross over to go to West County Mall. We do keep an eye on this, but we didn't want to put a signal in to stop the main flow of Manchester traffic. I will have our traffic engineer double check the volumes on these turns again.

Q: Were you always a performer?
The Four Seasons is a timeless old-style Hawaiian resort — tiki torches, orchid leis and all — which is fine with me. "We absolutely celebrate that fact," Whitfield said.

But the easiest tanking decision comes when there is a great player available at No. 1, and potential franchise players behind him, too.
This is not to say that you shouldn't use any passive treatments.

Since scoring 15 points against Howard in week five, Oakland Mills has scored less points each week since (7, 6, 0). If the Scorpions can score two touchdowns against a Hammond defense that has allowed 73 points in the last two weeks, it would be a small victory at the end of a long season.

Years of experience have taught me that real reconciliation cannot occur without two essential ingredients: trust and truth.

Im not about equality of result when it comes to income inequality. There is income inequality in America. There always has been, and hopefully, and I do say that, there always will be. Why?

It is a balancing act, conducted with one guiding principle: Do not judge.
"It looks like too regular a house to give rise to such a character," Cumming said. His favorite Addams Family character? Gomez.
Sandwiches were generally disappointing, and I think the weak bread is to blame. This was true of the grilled cheese and a Thanksgiving sandwich with turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce. Even the famous cheese toast that Cafe Hon serves its egg salad sandwich on is dry and airy. The best sandwich is the Reuben, which Cafe Hon actually grills instead of throwing under some heat.
Drones come in a variety of sizes, ranging from large aircraft with 116-foot wingspans to tiny craft that can weigh less than an ounce. Under the new FAA rules, civilian drones must weigh less than 55 pounds, stay below an altitude of 400 feet and remain within sight of their operators.

Comment From Lilia: I am participating in LA marathon on Sunday and wirily be outside for over 8 hours walking in the rain. Shall I be conserned about radiation exposure during that time?
NV Scharffenberger Mendocino County Brut ($19, 12%): This label's marriage with its neighbor, Roederer Estate, continues to pay off. Scharffenberger now might be American sparkling's true outperformer. Even with full malolactic fermentation to soften the texture, this remains fresh and steely. Green apple, poppy seed, grated lemon, morning bun and chalky mineral flavors mesh perfectly.
The ML seats five comfortably; drivers with more passengers than cargo will have to wait until the 2013 model year, when Mercedes will offer it with seven seats. For now, the cargo space is average for this segment, though the rear seats fold completely flat if needed.
Almost forgotten after the sellout crowd calmed down was that the Blues increased their NHL-best point total to 105, staying two ahead of the New York Rangers, who won Tuesday. The Blues put more separation between them and Vancouver, No. 2 in the West with 101 points. They also added distance from Detroit and Nashville, Nos. 2-3 in the Central Division with 97 and 96 points, respectively.
Even that has risks because of the large area and depth of contamination. Excavation could pose a health risk because it would require digging a mammoth hole in the ground that could allow harmful vapors to escape.
In hindsight, there were several warning flags as Bart Ross worked his way through the judicial system.
I took these instructions to heart. I wrote two lines at every stop. I may not win the poetry contest based on content, but I would wager I wrote the longest poem, and at the same time, immensely entertained myself.
As always, we're going to give you a pick, a score and a reason why. There are some upsets (see Games 8, 12, 18 and 48) and a surprising Final Four entrant. And as we always say: Enjoy and copy at your own risk.
I visited Denson on Thursday. Her house is one of a group of 14 Habitat for Humanity houses just off Birdie Hills Road. It's a three-bedroom, 1,401-square-foot house. It was clean and sparsely furnished. Two old televisions dominate the living room. One doesn't work.

“Are you excited?,” she asked the father, who, in his grey suit, looked out of place in the sea of hot pink, electric blue, and black leather.
When we've tried to take this series of bumps in the past at higher speeds (above 20 mph) in the regular TRD Tacoma, the results were both jarring and unnerving. It was easy to tell we were running outside the suspension setup's capabilities. However, when trying the same section in the Baja Series, the shocks made all the difference. At 20, 30 and 40 mph, the series of ruts and bumps felt like they were getting smoother. In high-range four-wheel drive, we found the best way to keep control of the Tacoma was to keep the revs high (around 3,000 or 4,000 rpm) in 2nd or 3rd gear (depending on speed) and aim for the tops of the whoops. In fact, after just a short amount of time, it was clear from the feel of the truck that it could do higher speeds as well, which we did.
Feldman: I'm not sure thinking about growth in philanthropy is realistic. So we're thinking a lot more about how to become more self-sufficient and to earn more of our money. Things like the global internet provide opportunities to do that.
Real Madrid could well have lost at Camp Nou and still won La Liga. But actually defeating its eternal rival is something of a game-changer. Mourinho may not admit it, but he didn't just get a monkey off his back, he banished a whole pack of screaming orangutans.

College isn't cool on the GOP campaign trail.
Between 1990 and 2007, when U.S. maritime trade peaked as the recession took hold, there was a fourfold increase in containerized trade through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. In the process, the two San Pedro Bay ports became the nation's busiest maritime gateway. Container traffic through the Port of Oakland, meanwhile, more than doubled.
Defensive coordinator Perry Fewell and his staff. The Giants played exclusively in the nickel Sunday. They switched up the personnel a bit to freshen it up, but they had five DBs on the field for every single play except one, by my count. The loss of middle LB Jonathan Goff has forced Fewell to play mostly nickel this season. But to do it exclusively and to play so well on defense against the Pats for much of the game is a credit to the scheme, the coaches and the players.
Youngblood, who didn't score in the triple jump on Thursday, scored five points for fourth place in the long jump. She got her best jump on her fifth attempt, with a mark of 21-3 1/4.
"It requires a real mindset change," Stokes said. "I wasn't ready for it."
"I'm drawn to public service," said Bush, who lives in Fort Worth. "Given the opportunity and the stars align, I'd definitely like to consider it. But nothing's on the table right now." Bush said he's "more drawn to state government," with a particular interest in education and "making our taxpayer dollars more accountable to the end user, which is the state taxpayer."
"A woman writer is 'rowing against wind and tide,'" Anne Morrow Lindbergh told her daughter Reeve in 1972, quoting Harriet Beecher Stowe. "We cannot — or only with the greatest difficulty — produce a great 'body of work.'… And it isn't just being a woman. It is some other deeper conflict between art and life." Ultimately, Lindbergh made art from her life; this posthumous collection joins five earlier volumes of diaries and correspondence that explore her experiences with the subtlety and drama of a good novel.
Channing Tatum revisits his stripper past, this time as mentor to a hungry young 'un played by Alex Pettyfer. Steven Soderbergh directs this dramedy. High time, film turned its gaze to a different sort of pole dancer. (June 29, R)

Air samplings along the south edge of the property, which is lined by houses, showed methane concentrations of 30 to 40 percent a couple of years ago, Schwarz said. Methane's explosive range is between 5 and 15 percent concentration; heavier than that and there isn't enough oxygen to sustain a fire, but the higher readings were still troubling. However, the most recent readings were "quite low," below 5 percent, and the methane extraction system is "working quite well," he says.
In better times, they've offered a flying car, a submarine, a custom-fitted medieval suit of armor and even an adult-size mermaid suit. During the 1970s recession, Reeder said the catalog contained optimist and pessimist fantasy gifts.

They have legs, arms, seats, backs and headrests, and Wagner has arranged them provocatively to suggest conviviality, rejection, hostility and chaos.
Most cities renew their contracts with the Orange County Sheriff's Department yearly. When the 2013 contracts come up, county officials will ask for no less than a five-year commitment from its 12 contract cities.

Finally, clothes also figure in the humanity of those who tended to the poorest wretches brought aboard the rescue ship Carpathia. Jones quoted from a letter of a passenger who remembered, "I was very busy ... cutting out garments for the steerage and second-class children, some of whom had no clothes at all. We make little coats and leggings out of the blankets."
Beyond the theoretical solutions, the reality on the snow has been gruesome. At Tahoe's Alpine Meadows during the Christmas-New Year holidays, a snowboarder, 25, was found dead in a tree well in wilderness adjacent to the resort. In Wyoming, also during the holidays, a 22-year-old snowboarder crashed into a mother and her 5-year-old daughter who were stopped on a hill, killing himself and the girl. The latest fatal accident occurred Saturday at Granlibakken, a small North Tahoe resort, where a 22-year-old snowboarder from Oakland, Rahsheka Keith, reportedly tried to use her board as a sled, became turned around and rammed into the support pole of a lift tower.
Even so, the mystery has lost none of its allure, consuming marine architects and amateur sleuths alike for decades. Philip Sims, a former U.S. Navy marine architect, says Ballard and his team's discovery opened up "the whole ocean of undersea wrecks," particularly because of revolutionary deep-sea technology. Sims will be a speaker today at the International Marine Forensics Symposium in National Harbor, Md., where attendees will revisit the sinking of Titanic and other famed ships.

In case you've jumped to the conclusion that Pizzeria Ortica may have been inspired by Pizzeria Mozza, I'd say you're probably right. What chef wouldn't want to emulate the success of the Silverton-Batali juggernaut? But Pizzeria Ortica is not a carbon copy. For one thing, the menu includes pasta, some of the best in Southern California, plus a fine antipasti and salad menu, and a handful of well-conceived main courses.
Environmental groups had pushed for curbs on greenhouse gas emissions, blamed for global warming, and challenged the Bush administration for blocking a waiver request from California to pursue more stringent air pollution rules than required by the federal government. The request was granted by the Obama administration last year.
Saturday afternoon, referee Karl Hess ejected two former N.C. State greats — former NBAer Tom Gugliotta and Chris Corchiani — from the Wolfpack's game against Florida State. Hess refused to answer why he tossed two fans from the game. That's just another example of the officials flexing their muscle, but with no accountability. We're not asking that all officials — the majority of whom do an excellent job under tough circumstances — explain every decision, but there needs to be a system put into place where questions can be asked or things explained. It will make everyone's lives much easier. In the instance on Saturday, what is the harm in explaining why Gugliotta and Corchiani were tossed? Or more commonly, where is the downside in giving the reasoning behind a disputed foul call at the end of a game? There is none. Officials — like coaches and players — should enter the realm of having a forum answer tough questions when the situations call for it.
Raising the direst alarm yet, his administration warned fellow Democrats on Wednesday that if they defeat the tax plan, they could jolt the nation back into recession.

You need to carefully trace each runner back to its source. Then you have two choices: Dig the roots out, or cut the vine off and paint the stump with undiluted Eraser, Weed-Master, Credit 41 or other 41 percent glyphosate herbicide or a 50 percent solution of Roundup.
With weather like this, however, it’s easy to be fooled. Statewide, sunny skies and temperatures in the 60s Wednesday likely had many across New Jersey thinking spring, but for March, it’s pretty much par for the course.
But that was last fall, before the mid-term elections. And before the tax backlash. And before a new state income tax rate that ballooned 66 percent.

In the near future, science develops a way to make people stop aging at 25. Pretty sweet, except that everyone is also genetically engineered to only live one more year. They can buy more time, allowing the rich go on living at 25 indefinably, while everyone else's clock runs out. Justin Timberlake plays a man accused of murder, who then sets out to shake up the system, with a hostage Amanda Seyfried in tow. Though, pretty sure Timberlake turned 30 this year...
Elmer used a restaurant-quality raspberry jam for the filling, but you can use seedless raspberry jam from the grocery store. Put it in a bowl and whip it up a bit for easy spreading, and spread all the way to the edge of the cake layers.
James Kvaal, the campaign’s policy director, also dismissed Romney’s contention that getting government out of the way by cutting taxes, spending and regulations would spur job creation. “Efforts to cut our way to prosperity have been tried in the past, and Gov. Romney’s vision represents a return to those policies that have failed before,” he said.
"Especially at 1 in the morning," he said, "you have to fend for yourself."
Party delegates who decide endorsements generally are much further to the right than voters, as evidenced by a recent poll by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California.
State's Attorney Lawson Lamar has much to consider, with so many other band members likely involved in the hazing. Who to charge, and what to charge them with, must be decided under the glare of the national spotlight.
It was 2003 when Curtis kissed the Claret Jug at Royal St. George's with a square jawline and closely cropped black hair as the British Open champion. Sunday, he was handed a pair of cowboy boots, smiling with a rounder face and an appreciation of the journey.

“We felt that today’s deal provided us the opportunity to acquire several players that are at or near Major League ready and we could control for five to six years, all of whom have upside potential,” Zduriencik said. “We believe it improves the construction of our Major League roster by adding a right-handed bat and a left-handed arm immediately, and thanks to the young arms we have in our minor league system, we believe that we were able to add talent to our organization while dealing from an area of depth.
While hanging around North Beach and contemplating his future, Bittner, inspired by the eco-friendly writings of Gary Snyder, took to bird-watching. He soon focused his attention on his neighborhood's flock of cherry-headed conures (also known as red-masked parakeets), birds native to South America that either got away from, or were rejected by, their local owners, or escaped during shipment to pet stores. After a long period of patiently building trust, Bittner bonded with the animals, and the results, as captured by filmmaker Judy Irving, are fun to watch. The parrots not only eat out of Bittner's hands, but perch on his shoulders and head as he addresses them by name. Bittner got to know his feathered friends so well that he could recognize individuals, and he happily recounts their stories.
That compared with a surplus of $5.35 billion in March and a deficit of $31.5 billion in February. China often has a large trade deficit early in the year as factories restock after their long lunar new year holiday break.

He was appointed to the Ward B seat on April 6 after Councilwoman Mary Spinello resigned, just weeks before the May 12 election. She had left to head the Jersey City Parking Authority, and the council voted to replace her for the short stretch in what some deemed an inappropriate attempt to give Kenny the "incumbent'' advantage come Election Day.

Prosecutors say the used-car salesman, who owed a debt to a third party, approached Jenkins about the situation and asked for help.
The Thunder didn't immediately announce whether Harden, who scored 14 points, had a concussion. Bryant and other Lakers acknowledged World Peace is likely to face a multigame suspension with just one game left in their regular season.
But the rule can -- and should -- be your law in your car. Ask back-seat passengers to lock in those seat belts before starting a trip. Far too few of us do that. The LeaseTrader survey indicated only 2 percent of drivers routinely make the safety request over their shoulder. Less than 8 percent ask even half of the time.
“This is an outstanding facility, absolutely outstanding,” Coughlin said. “What I like about it is that the college teams here have been working all fall, so the turf has been broken in well. It’s settled in, and it’s in great shape. It’s going to be great for our players to work out in here all week.”
The late surge before the caucuses for Santorum was the first exhibit, Crawford said. Since then, Republicans elected no self-identified Romney supporters to the Iowa GOP state central committee, Ron Paul backers made a successful play to gain ground within the party structure, the two national committee representatives and state chair refused to sign a delegate loyalty pledge, the party booked a fundraising keynote speaker who has said hes not enthused about Romney, and various outspoken activists have expressed their reluctance about him.
"Ninety-five percent of employees, contrary to popular belief, do their job," said Pagnotta-Murphy, who supervises a small team that maintains city vehicles.
Why do we think Crosby's peeps are behind this? The item reads: "'She is heartbroken, but she is already writing great songs about it,' the pal says. The singer will keep herself busy with an upcoming tour to promote her album Flawz, the friend notes." Way to stay on message.
At a sidewalk picnic table, I talked beer with 5Q regulars Zach Christensen and Heidi Leibbrandt, who make their own brew and grow hops at their nearby home. Christensen, who's "in telecom," nursed a pint of Lompoc's C-Note pale ale, brewed with seven hops that start with "C" (Crystal, Cluster, Cascade, Chinook, Centennial, Columbus and Challenger). It rates a chart-topping 100 International Bitterness Units, a measure of hop infusion, which Portland beer geeks bandy about the way wine fans talk about grippy tannins.
The airport is also seeking to attract more carriers. On Tuesday, the county Board of Supervisors authorized a $250,000 cash offer to Virgin America to lure it to Sacramento. That money would come from an existing program funded by airport restaurants and shops.

What advice would you give incoming freshmen? That they should get involved. Getting involved with the things that interest a student will teach him far more than a classroom ever could. I would also tell students to follow their hearts and their passions and that everything else will fall into place. Finally, take every opportunity that is afforded, as one does not know where these opportunities will lead.
And at some point in 2012, he will take them to Baltimore.
Kimbrough traveled to more than 40 countries. After meeting several women in Nigeria who were struggling to help children with developmental disabilities, she helped start an educational center for children there.

"Mitt Romney drew more young voters in Florida than in 2008, but the low turnout still raises questions about his appeal to youth," the center's director, Peter Levine, said in a prepared statement.
The governor tried to raise the cigarette tax before, as did his predecessor, Rod Blagojevich. The two most recent proposals passed in the Illinois Senate but died in the House. The cigarette tax was last increased in 2002, from 58 cents to 98 cents, under Republican Gov. George Ryan.
If swing voters ask that question, and vote accordingly, Romney may find that his primary season Achilles heel has become his saving grace. And Obama may find that his presumptuous promises of second-term flexibility never come to pass.

The Institute for Supply Management's better-than-expected report, improving manufacturing data overseas and a surprise jump in U.S. construction spending in June, helped push stock markets higher.

The newspaper found the agency — which treats the sewage of more than 1.3 million people in Essex, Bergen, Passaic and Hudson counties — was being used by its commissioners as a private piggy bank, hiring wives, brothers, in-laws and children; approving special-interest contracts; and hiring of politically connected officials at six-figure salaries.
Kim was not eligible for the Masters. He is not exempt for the U.S. Open. Tuesday was the first time he hit balls since he withdrew from the Texas Open. After one swing, he clutched his right elbow. There was a duck-hook with the driver, another shot that resembled a shank. The other shots were mostly good, though Kim said he still feels a jolt in his elbow even after hitting wedges.
The many theorists out there who believe Cuomo wants President Obama to lose in November in order to abet his own presidential aspirations will find support on Page 25 of the speech, where, when noting the new federal health-care law should cut some insurance costs in New York, the governor failed to give Obama any credit for his signature plan.

That's a tiny number in relative terms, and the Snake River fish still have to make it to their home lakes in central Idaho. But it's the highest sockeye return recorded at Lower Granite since it was built in 1975, and nearly 25 times the average return of the last 10 years. Ten years ago two sockeye came back.

It's gorgeous to look at, but a little incongruous, given the rest of the artist's career. So it makes sense to follow the example of Val Espinoza, a fellow tourist I met on the steps beneath Rivera's allegory. Espinoza and his wife, Rosa, had come from Fresno just to look at Rivera murals, and this was one of three stops for them. (I'll have to check out these two others on my next trip.)

Thursday night's scene featured a bit of everything. There were white people, black people, elderly couples, children in strollers and dogs on leashes. T-shirt sellers were getting $10 for shirts with Zimmerman's picture below a huge "WANTED" sign. Other T-shirts read, "I am Trayvon Martin," underscoring the theme of many speakers' comments that anybody could fall victim to a bullet if confronted by someone carrying a loaded gun and claiming self-defense.

The ash cloud, drifting between 20,000 to 30,000 feet (6,000 to 9,000 meters) high and invisible from the ground, initially blocked the main air flight path between the U.S. east coast and Europe. On Friday, the cloud's trajectory was taking it over northern France and Austria and into eastern and central Russia at about 25 mph (40 kph).
"Also, I don't believe it should start at pre-1967, at those boundaries. I disagreed with the president on that, as did Harry Reid in in a speech that night and others. But I think that they are moving towards an agreement on which way to go."

Manufacturers of Class 1 devices — gadgets with few or no moving parts, such as tongue depressors, usually have to simply register with the FDA. When the agency allows such devices to go to market, "they aren't passing judgment that one tongue depressor is any better than any other tongue depressor," Maisel says. "They're just saying it's a safe device."
Of his own performance as "The Wild One"-channeling teen rebel Mutt (who turns out to be Indy's son), LaBeouf says this: "You get to monkey-swinging and things like that and you can blame it on the writer and you can blame it on Steven. But the actor's job is to make it come alive and make it work, and I couldn't do it. So that's my fault. Simple."
"I'm sure I could go out and say, `Please, don't do anything negative,'" Romney told Fox News. "But this is politics. And if you can't stand the heat in this little kitchen, wait until Obama's Hell's Kitchen turns up the heat."

What would Jesus do about today's arguments over sexual identity? I don't know. He didn't say. Matthew 7:12 is the best I've found: "So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets."
Since then we have made other furniture for him -- always with a perch feature that he can curl his talons around comfortably. It's very awkward for him to walk flat-footed. He spends most of the time on a perch on top of the dresser, munching and making quiet, conversational noises. He usually comes twice a day -- an hour or so after sunrise (which makes us avid supporters of daylight-saving time) -- and an hour or so before sunset.
In addition to Cottrell, Foster and her infant daughter, the duplex also was home to Foster's 20-year-old boyfriend, and his 11 siblings, mother and stepfather, according to investigators.

"Fortunately, while I write about the struggle, I wake up in the morning most of the time with a smile on my face, and I've managed to make it to the other side of these things. But I know if I just stay true to the experience, and to what I see as real, it's not gonna leave 'em in a dark place -- it just exposes a dark place. I guess what I'm saying is that it's OK to talk about it. I also think if I explain how hard is has been for me, people don't feel so alone. I know that's my reaction when I listen to sad, hard songs -- 'Oh God, they went through that, too. I'm not so alone.'"

Smith called much of past and current leadership "an elite clique whose sole agenda consisted of nothing more than personal gain and self enrichment." Some of his conclusions, Smith said, were based on personal observations as operations commander of Camp Roberts a few years ago.
Most voters may be unaware of the initiative. It was ordered placed on the ballot earlier this month.

Medical Center in Albuquerque, NM.
The use of drone aircraft perpetuates the illusion that military force is an effective means of countering terrorism and resolving political differences. We should know better by now. After 10 years of combat in Afghanistan the threat of terrorist attack and insurgent violence remains as great as ever. May 2011 was the deadliest month for Afghan civilians since the U.N. began keeping records in 2007, the agency's Assistance Mission in Afghanistan reported. June's death toll was almost as high.

"The Maryland State Board of Education has already looked at this issue from this particular document and said it's not an education issue," Dyer said to Aquino.

The fact that Paul and Rachel Chandler couldn't pay a big ransom helped stretch out their ordeal to 388 agonizing days - until Sunday, when they were released, thin and exhausted but smiling.

Another find is the Chopra Center, which moved from La Jolla to the La Costa Resort. Deepak Chopra, the most popular evangelist of traditional Indian medicine, has his U.S. headquarters in a resort surrounded by tennis pros and polo-shirted golfers. For a while, Chopra was offering a way to integrate Indian mental centering techniques with golf – though I didn't see it on the spa menu. The materials did mention that those with a "pitta dosha" personality (one of the Ayurvedic body types) can be especially angry when they hit a bad shot. There is a full menu of yoga and meditation. It's a world within the La Costa world – and one that fits the word "east."
School construction manager Dave Tillou said there is good news. Some of the board’s professionals, such as its architect and engineers, are reducing their charges because, in part, “the job is getting done faster than anticipated.” The kitchen construction is finished and students were expected to be served hot meals on Tuesday for the first time this school year, said school superintendent Dr. Chrys Harttraft.

He was the spirit of the E Street Band, and the oaken staff that Bruce Springsteen leaned on.
Yet what is best for the rest of us isn’t necessarily what is best for Rondo. He’s 26. He still has some youthful defiance in him. He still has some youthful arrogance. He’s not Ray Allen. He’s not the personification of coolness and mature professionalism. Rondo can be brash. His teammates call him "Swag" for a reason. He does things like throw a ball at a referee in anger in February. He is young and stubborn. And that’s why he would stand there and not only resist saying he was sorry, but insist he had nothing to prove in this game.

As for the government rescue of Chrysler and General Motors, he said it was the right thing to do -- "You never want to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people going without a job" -- and said Romney, despite saying he was against the rescue package as President Barack Obama presented it, would have "done what he thought was for the best to save the jobs and minimize the impact on the economy."

A thought for all of us sentenced to a 24/7 news cycle wherein every comment, statement or aside is endlessly vetted: Give 'em a break. Presidential campaigns are political pressure cookers. Politicians are human beings. They can get tired, cranky and careless. They remind us that nobody is perfect. As much as we might like to revel in the difficulties of our political opponents, obvious misstatements should not become prime campaign fodder. Our unsettled economy and numerous military engagements around the world provide us plenty of real issues to debate. Given the high stakes involved, we can do better than this.

"We don't know yet what might be able to be developed there, but the notion of being able to explore his property and see if some beautifully designed family or senior housing can be developed there is too wonderful to pass up," said Thomas Peters, president and CEO of the foundation. "One of the incredible offers that Mr. Lucas made is that he would make available the extensive technical studies that have been done on that land, including water, topography, creek access and other engineering data that would give us a head start and help us determine whether senior or affordable housing can be built there."

Wisconsin's Supreme Court race this spring is likely to intensify the already heated national debate over judicial selection in the states. From the hyperbolic rhetoric in media reports, one would think that the very legitimacy of state courts is at stake when ignorant voters are allowed to decide whether judges should retain their jobs. The New York Times editorial board lamented last month: "Whoever ultimately gets the job, all of Wisconsin has lost. This nasty, highly politicized race is raising serious questions about the impartiality of the state's highest court."
Folkes asked himself that same question Tuesday night and couldn’t come up with an answer.

For red wines, that could mean a barbera, a red wine from northwestern Italy, or a white wine from France's Loire Valley.

Another possibility is Yarden Galilee Sauvignon Blanc 2009, imported from Israel.

In reality, the committee system in Congress has become increasingly irrelevant, especially with regard to what might be considered major or controversial legislation. Instead, most major policy decisions are made, not through a process of deliberation, but through the concerted efforts of party leadership and often with the total exclusion of not only minority party members but most of the rank and file membership of the majority party as well.

That's not to say that an Exelon-Constellation merger is a great thing. It still takes a corporate headquarters out of Baltimore, and as EDF officials have pointed out, it greatly diminishes the chances for the construction of a new nuclear reactor at Calvert Cliffs and will almost certainly result in the loss of high-paying jobs here. But the criteria on which the Public Service Commission can judge this deal are narrow: Does it provide benefits for BGE customers, does it produce no harm for them, and is it in the public interest? With the terms Mr. O'Malley secured, the commission should be able to answer all three in the affirmative.
But Gladis gets to show his bad-guy side on Sunday's "Leverage" (9 p.m., TNT).

Whatever we may owe Schenck as a Black Republican leader, pay him in money and send him to Dayton. His is no doubt an honorable man, a brave man, but when he talks of clearing the fog from around his name at the next opportunity, the soldiers under him feel that it is to be an any hazard of life to them, and they do not feel willing to needlessly sacrifice their lives to raise to the surface a politician who has gone under.

I have done well on clay, but I do think I can play on grass as well."

I don't even talk to my neighbors because my neighbors don't talk to me. I have never been so, I guess, dishonored. My mother who is like 78, out in the yard picking stuff and people don't talk to her. I would never walk by a person who was older than me and not pay them the respect.

And there have been a lot of cutbacks. It's pretty bleak. And at the very least, we need insurance legislation to go through and we have to figure out how do we help our children access treatment.

MIT and Harvard officials emphasized that they would use the new online platform not just to build a global community of online learners but also to research teaching methods and technologies. Online courses with thousands of students give researchers the ability to monitor students' progress, they said, identifying what they click on and where they have trouble. Already, a researcher from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, using the MIT Circuits course, found that students overwhelmingly preferred to read the handwritten notes of Agarwal rather than the same notes presented on PowerPoint.

I don't think so.
So it is encouraging that Gov. Jerry Brown is, like Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger before him, appointing jurists that are more reflective of California's composition. Brown, in fact, deserves credit for having placed a new emphasis on diversity in bench appointments during his two terms as governor in the 1970s. But that was three decades ago. Why is there still such a lag?
Seattle-area tactical officers who slogged for hours over dangerously steep, muddy ground to find him were prepared, too. They pumped in tear gas, called for him over bullhorns, and, after 22 hours, on Saturday set off explosives along the top of the bunker.

øSaldana, who left the Army in 2004, hasn't worked full time in 18 months. He's scoured "'help wanted" listings, taken college courses and earned an emergency medical technician certificate. But he finds himself pigeonholed. "What do you come out with having been an artillery man or in the infantry?" he asks. "The best job you can get is security. That's not what I want to do for the rest of my life."
5. Mix and match. It's not just OK to mix old with new; it's a new decor must. Caprara's living room combines modern-print sofas from West Elm with her refurbished thrift-store finds. The combination is warm, contemporary and one-of-a-kind.
No it wasn’t. It was a crazy, paranoid question. Four years ago, when a woman at one of his rallies began to rant about Barack Obama being an anti-American Muslim, presidential candidate John McCain took the microphone away and said she was wrong. Obama was a good American and a good family man with whom he simply disagreed, McCain said.

In Iran, rice pudding can be eaten as a meal on hot days, or as a token of respect at religious gatherings.

Another one of his employees also testified. Jim Duke, treasurer and controller at Executive Caterers, said he was made aware that the company issued two bills where 400-plus people attended political events for Dimora in 2006 -- but he did not know about it until after the corruption probe began.

Roberto Hernandez was placed on baseball's restricted list after he was arrested in the Dominican Republic on false identity charges last month. Authorities have said Hernandez is 31, three years older than he claimed.
What Gould is saying is that in a world this over-saturated, where we are overwhelmed by either obligation or distraction, the most essential act is the emptiest, the one that forces us to face that there is nothing behind humanity's facade. "Not one of the works of art in the gallery," he says of an attack on the Tate Modern, "remotely matched the limitless potency of a terrorist bomb." And later: "To keep the world sane we depend on motive, we rely on cause and effect. Kick those props away and we see that the meaningless act is the only one that has any meaning."
ø"I don't know. We have to figure that out. Some way, somehow," Anthony said. Everybody's got to do it.
The two men wound up buying the Watts Towers, which led to the formation of a citizens committee in 1959 to preserve and exhibit the walled complex of spires — the tallest is nearly 100 feet — and other structures decorated with broken pottery, seashells, glazed tiles and pieces of colored glass.

The orbiter had originally been set to soar over New York and New Jersey on Monday. The flyover was postponed due to rain and wind.
Why has it taken so long for this film to get made? I call it a poisoned chalice. People have been trying to make movies about Bob Marley for years, both fictions films and documentaries. At least a dozen fiction films have come and gone, and some of them are still trying to get made. It's a very complex, litigious world, the world of Marley. A lot of different people own various rights, and you need to get everybody on your side. But in the end I was able to use the footage and songs I wanted on a reasonable budget.
Every time things get horrifying, though, we cut back to the tech wizards who are orchestrating the whole experience. The “scares” are therefore “ironic” and, being safely cordoned off behind these “quotation marks,” aren’t scary. While some of the one-liners are funny, the only reason I could think of to keep watching is to learn what the overarching reason behind the setup might be. When this answer is delivered, though, it’s weak, and it is given in the clunkiest possible way: A new character simply walks onscreen and explains the back story. Worse: It’s a celebrity cameo. Worse still: The “reveal” nullifies everything the protagonists have been trying to do.
"Revenue," DiVincenzo said.
LAWRENCE, Kan.- Kansas star forward Thomas Robinson is declaring for the NBA draft and will forgo his senior season.

"I hope to remind children and teachers alike that learning should be fun and can have positive effects far beyond the classroom, because we're trying to equip students with the ability to critically evaluate their own situation," Clark said. "It's not about getting them to remember all the facts, but showing them how to make the best decision by understanding their personal situation and gathering as much information as they can."
“We’re not Jeremy Lin,” said Olasewere, “but to have a city like that on our back, and to represent ’em in a tournament like this, it’s a blessing.”
Under the rules of racing, a horse that loses its rider during a race is either listed as a non-starter or a non-finisher or is automatically listed as coming in last. To the establishment, the idea of a horse crossing the wire alone is just about as preposterous as a jockey trotting to the finish without a mount.
Health insurance companies also must cover oral cancer drugs, treating them on a "no less favorable basis that intravenous anticancer medications," according to another bill Christie also signed.
"I didn't think I was going to have anybody because I had the fastest time by 30 seconds," Fischer said. "Then Courtney Rogers came up and led six laps. I was trying to stay calm because I knew she was going to try to take off. When we had 800 meters left, I was like, ‘OK, I have to go now.' I probably should have kicked harder too then. I just haven't been lately, I don't know why."

Salinger's other books don't equal the influence or sales of "Catcher," but they are still read, again and again, with great affection and intensity. Critics, at least briefly, rated Salinger as a more accomplished and daring short story writer than John Cheever.
His team felt differently – that was clear by how they reacted to the victory. They rushed closer Reynaldo Hernandez after he punctuated the victory by striking out Castano. Minutes later, they dumped the Gatorade bucket on Mandl and whatever was left on Corniel. It had nothing to do with the opponent, Rodriguez said. It was about winning a title.

So I thought I'd put together a list of my favorite baseball movies of all time. The two most important factors in compiling the list were that they had to be about baseball, and I had to be willing to watch them more than once.
“Do it. You’ve got to do it,” he said. “You’ve got to go through situations where you don’t have success to learn what you did wrong, the defining moments within a series where you have to find a way to get through it and be successful. That hasn’t happened here. I think we’ve added pieces over the last couple years that have been through that a little bit and that’s going to help this time around.

This week, I digress from my normal weekly rant about my household foibles and fiascos to bring you some actual breaking news: I met Martha Stewart.
Elias, by all accounts, had been playing well but was missing that tally. For a playmaker and goal-scorer, it built up some tension. It was visible to his teammates, who tried allaying him. But when your role is defined by numbers, their words weren’t as potent as goals.
Coming off a wave election of their own in 2010, Republicans need to add only four Senate seats (three, if they win the White House) to regain the majority. First-termers like Brown are prime targets, especially if they're also from states like Ohio, where President Barack Obama's approval ratings are underwater. Brown's unapologetic liberalism and often zealous partisanship make him an especially inviting target. In 34-year-old Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, the GOP has a challenger with a strong personal story, little public record to attack, a proven ability to raise money and a willingness -- shown in 2010 -- to do whatever it takes to win.

Durga Nath takes out a battered suitcase filled with snake charmer memorabilia. He once traveled to Japan (a real "snakes on a plane") for a charmer publicity stunt, appeared in the 2010 Commonwealth Games' opening ceremony, and was summoned by authorities in 1999 when Hindu right-wingers threatened to release several slithery specimens during an India-Pakistan cricket match.

The parents, who met earlier Monday with Bloomington police, would particularly like to hear from Corey Rossman, one of the students who was with Lauren Spierer that night.
The critics have also wondered aloud - from radio and television sports shows to newspaper columns and even Monday-morning-quarterback perches - whether Tim Tebow has the right stuff to be an NFL quarterback. And though not always a Tebow believer, I've been born again by a young QB who continues somehow to find a way to win.
Ohio is on the right track with these bills. Pension forfeiture should be the rule, not the exception, when someone who is supposed to be serving the public betrays the public instead. The public should not have to finance the retirement of an employee or officeholder guilty of malfeasance.

So, yes, there probably will be grief during menopause, Northrup writes. "There's a death of the old self," she says, perhaps a loss of certain identities.

I'd hazard to say that most of the dudes behind the "Brokeback" mashups haven't seen the film. No matter; having parodied it, they'll want to check it out. And I have a dream, see. I dream that somewhere out in Bushland people who missed "Brokeback Mountain" in theaters, either through their own fear or their neighborhood Cineplex's refusal to show it, will feel safe ordering it from Netflix and watching it in the privacy of their shag-carpeted living rooms, sandwiched between "American Pie II" and that sanctimonious exercise in sadomasochism, "The Passion of the Christ." Maybe they'll even toss in "Evil Dead," just for chuckles.
The state does not pay anything toward room and board costs at residential health care facilities such as Dover Woods, but requires operators to set aside $114 of a tenant’s $908 monthly supplemental security income check for a personal allowance, Department of Community Affairs spokeswoman Lisa Ryan said.

South Carolina state Rep. Nathan Ballentine, a Wells Fargo mortgage officer in Chapin, S.C., was one of the first state legislators to endorse Romney - 11 months ago.

"When I was thinking of songs I was writing, I kept thinking about elementary school ... where we were all singing and banging on tambourines out of time," he says.

(Though not included in the retrospective, another Bogart classic, 1951's "The African Queen," for which he won his only best actor Oscar, is arriving on DVD on March 23. The Technicolor film, directed by John Huston and also starring Katharine Hepburn, has been beautifully restored.)

The dresses were either jeweled or jewel-toned and both mean that accessories were superfluous.
But Palombino works the obscure repertory like an overreaching cabaret artist. Odd combos click one time in four. Bay scallops from Long Island’s Peconic waters — “We’re one of only two restaurants that get them,” the waitress beamed — were served in their shells over fiery kimchi that smartly parried the scallops’ sweetness.
Dr. Michael Dent, pastor of Denver's historic Trinity United Methodist Church, will speak on " Lessons from the Unsinkable Ship" at the church on April 15 at 8:15 and 11:15 a.m.

But live TV has taken on a mystique for both performers and viewers ever since video tape was invented during TV's infancy in the 1950s. The arrival of video tape made live production a bold choice and an exercise in daring—rather than the bothersome necessity it had been before, when no alternative existed.
Williams met Garces when she started working as a nanny for his son, Zach, when Williams was married to his first wife, Valerie Velardi. The tabloids had a field day when he married Garces shortly after his divorce was finalized.

Tomorrow night is the AT&T Cotton Bowl. Then on Saturday, the BBVA Compass Bowl, Sunday the GoDaddy.Com Bowl and finally Monday the AllState BCS National Championship! But today nothing!

"They are better off because of that," Biggs said. "Somebody else is paying for a greater share of their health care. This will get me hate mail, obviously. But it is what it is."
Much of the discussion surrounding the anniversary of bin Laden's death, however, has focused not on national security but on politics. President Barack Obama has made his decision to launch the mission that killed bin Laden a part of his re-election campaign, and Republicans have roundly criticized him for exploiting that success for partisan advantage. Of course, there's more than a bit of hypocrisy in the GOP complaint, since President George W. Bush used the capture of Saddam Hussein for similar purposes when he ran for re-election.
"When that will happen, I don't know," Kubiak said. "My focus now is strictly with T.J. and Kellen, and moving forward with Atlanta."
"If you have to rely just on momentum then you don't have a good enough team," Auriemma said. "We've got to hope we have a good enough team and then rely on momentum as an extra asset."

Around the table, there are going to be varying degrees of interest in or experience with wine, and that in itself presents a challenge. It is nearly impossible to find the one perfect wine, so I recommend offering at least two choices that will cover most taste preferences and pairings. Here's a short list, all purchased at Safeway.
Sugarman, Gullickson, and Bailey are the only holdovers from Steve Spagnuolo's staff.

A bigger bonus and higher salary boosted Ronald Saks' total pay to $429,577 as chief executive of LMI Aerospace. That's an 11 percent increase over 2010, according to figures in a proxy statement filed today.
"There's going to be a lot of factors - guys are going to get demoralized, they'll start to splinter or start to give up, and we can't let that happen. We've got to be professional, we got to take pride in what we're doing and fight for each other and see how many of these games we can win."
Oregon roughed up UCLA (20-6, 7-3) starter Adam Plutko early scoring five runs in the game's first four innings.
In Marion County, mounting shortfalls make any relief unlikely. The nearly $1 billion city-county budget didn't result in a tax increase, but the city balanced it using about $40 million from a special Downtown taxing district intended to support economic development.
Voting has now ended. Watch for a new round to begin this evening.
Residential appraisals will be based on a computer program that analyzes the characteristics of each house and the neighborhood's sales history. The final value will reflect the value of the land and the cost of building a similar replacement house, minus depreciation.
After striking out twice with the courts, park officials are asking the public to do what $65 million spent over the course of 15 years and four park superintendents have failed to do – come up with a viable strategy to balance public access against the strict protections that come with the river's 1987 congressional designation as "Wild and Scenic."

These episodes and others led Moran to vegetarianism — she first tried it as a young teenager, consuming nothing but fruit cocktail and cottage cheese for four months — and, later, to veganism: no meat, no fish, no dairy, no eggs.
Ryan and other politicians tend not to subtract the $1 trillion when mentioning the infrastructure deficit, a point of clarification. But the American Society of Civil Engineers also told PolitiFact that the numbers don't account for flooding and other calamities that have weakened or destroyed infrastructure since the 2009 study was released, and that the $2.2 trillion need probably has not gone down.
The contract is for the master plan update and on-call airport planning services for three years, with an option for a two-year renewal. It's worth up to $3 million for the first year.

I want to believe a lakefront fisherman will top the Illinois record (2-8.75), which was caught by Joseph Grega of Coal City on Jan. 5, 1974, from the old Arrowhead Club Lake in Will County, but I begin to wonder.

In May, Hemann completed her senior year at Breese Central High School with a second consecutive year of winning four individual state Class 1A track titles. Not only did she set a state record in the long jump (20 feet 1 inch) and the 100-meter dash (12:02), she claimed the triple jump (37 feet, 11.75 inches), and high jump (5-foot-7). Her pre state finals long jump of 20-1 1/2 was a national best, and her 6-1 high jump 1/4 inch short of the 2011 national high.

Alexander M. Cutler, Eaton's current chairman and chief executive officer, called de Windt "an exception leader" and praised his "unwavering commitment to the community and civic causes."
For the past 27 years, Farley has been the disc jockey at the monthly Friday-night dance that Portland Parks & Recreation holds for people who are developmentally disabled. Now 66, Farley moved to Portland in 1980. In addition to a regular job, he had a side gig as DJ for weddings, parties and corporate events. One week, he got a call from another DJ asking if he could fill in at the parks dance. Farley knew nothing about it. His competitor gave him the rundown, but said the job didn't pay much. But Farley, divorced and with two kids ages 3 and 5, wasn't one to turn down any job.
"We've got a discrepancy in how doctors are paid," said Wemer. "Primary care doctors, the ones who listen to you, they're underpaid. But specialists get paid way over what they're worth."
The man was working on a portion of a state Department of Transportation resurfacing project on nearby Interstate 287, for which Route 22 is being used as a staging area, the DOT said.
One of McMillan's weaknesses is that players view him as controlling. His Blazers teams have been methodical and careful in their play. He typically has called the offensive sets from the sideline. You know, the whole "Sarge" persona.
"We haven't beaten (Arizona) since '06," the Rams defensive tackle said. "We haven't beaten Seattle since '05. We haven't beat San Fran since '07."

Dwayne Browder ran the event from a chair and, for a while, without a microphone. He's a housing activist and legend in his own right, who has helped organize sports programs in public housing for decades. Nothing happens without him.
“It would put an undue burden on our general fund,” said Cleveland Finance Director Sharon Dumas, who could see police and fire retirement costs rise by $6 million from the $32 million the city already spends. “They’re already significantly high. We would vehemently oppose any increases to the fund.”
Scalia wasn't the only ill-tempered justice in the chamber. Samuel Alito rolled his eyes to the ceiling and shook his head in objection when two liberal justices spoke. And Sotomayor took a shot at the conservative justices when she referred to "those of us for whom legislative history has some importance."
When conventional hybrids and alternative-fuel vehicles were allowed onto the southbound 110 during afternoon rush hour two years ago, they accounted for almost 1 in 5 vehicles in the carpool lane, according to the MTA.
"Disclosure alone will never be enough to prevent health insurers from charging unreasonable insurance premiums. To protect consumers, regulators must have the power to review and reject excessive rates," said Carmen Balber, Washington director for California-based Consumer Watchdog.
In August, President Obama and European allies publicly called on Assad to step down. But despite his government's bloody response to its own people, Western military intervention, which theoretically could speed Assad's departure, seems to be off the table. Any such undertaking would encounter objections from Russia and China, veto-wielding nuclear powers on the United Nations Security Council; the challenge ofSyria's difficult terrain and extensive antiaircraft batteries; and uncertainty about a largely unknown opposition that may include a substantial contingent of Islamist militants.
Mrs. Laval also thought nothing of giving us all big red Ds for missing an author's intent, which happened a lot. She expected breadth and depth in writing from a bunch of hormone-deranged 15-year-olds, and more than once in a while she got it.
A report published in the March issue of the journal Health Affairs says children across the United States now snack almost three times a day on candy, chips and other nutritionless food. That's on top of their three meals a day.

St. Louis catcher Yadier Molina left the game in the ninth inning after being hit in the back of his gloved hand trying to snag a pitch by reliever Mitchell Boggs. Preliminary X-rays were negative.

Garza watch: Matt Garza's airmailed throw to first in Thursday's game cost him a chance at a complete game shutout and solidified his standing as one of the worst fielding pitchers in the league.
The Rams rolled over Branham 16-0 last week, crushing 18 hits in the win. John Riley smashed the ball all over the yard, ripping a double, a triple and a pair of singles. James Hatano proved to be too much for the Branham pitchers, too, belting three hits in his three at bats. He also drove in two.

Here was Detroit's franchise player, sore knee, coming off his birthday, and he wouldn't consider anything but practice. There are a lot of reasons you would like the Wings to win it all this year. One of them is still owed a cake and candles.
"I think the state Legislature and the governor were supportive of a tax increase under those conditions," he said. "And I think before the due date comes to eliminate that, it needs to be strongly looked at to find out where the additional revenues went."

American's parent company, AMR Corp., and its chief bankruptcy lawyer have raised the possibility that the company could freeze or terminate pension plans that cover about 130,000 employees and retirees. The company could make its intentions clear on Wednesday, when it presents new contract proposals to its unions.
She said Ohio relies heavily on manufacturing and when the economy dips, so does employment. Laying the blame on Strickland for the loss of nearly 400,000 jobs since he took office in 2007, as Kasich does, is "inflammatory and misleading," Frisby said.
"We went through some true adversity," senior wideout Juron Criner said. "We had a lot of walls in front of us - we ran into some and we jumped over some."
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The judge presiding over the trial of serial-killings defendant Anthony Sowell issued an order Tuesday banning reporters from quoting prospective jurors or in any way identifying them, a move The Plain Dealer intends to challenge.
The second attempt was blocked by Jason Pierre-Paul with 1 second remaining, allowing the Giants to hold on for a 37-34 victory tonight and move into a tie for first place in the NFC East.
Since he came to power in 2009, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has had little regard for the Obama administration's opinions — because the president has not been afraid to speak his mind about Israel's intransigence and a policy which might be dubbed "shoot first, ask questions later." Let us hope that President Obama can remain firmly for a peaceful resolution to an increasingly tense situation.
Newark police investigated Lockyer's complaint that Chikhani attacked her, but because she used to work for the Alameda County District Attorney's Office, the case was passed along to the state Justice Department.
In the NFL, he had Tony Dorsett.
At some point since, Capstone made a decision to demolish the older South Plant. Denny Coleman, executive director of the St. Louis County Economic Council, said he first heard of that plan about a month ago, in a meeting with Capstone. They want to knock down the South plant and sell its metal to fund heating and maintenance on the newer North plant.
He took his wife, Fanny, and his infant son, John L., to Titusville, Pa., where Col. Edwin Drake had recently discovered how to drill into rich veins of oil under the Pennsylvania countryside.
In his speech, Cameron decried multiculturalism's "hands-off tolerance" of some cultural behaviors -- he used the example of forced marriages -- that are antithetical to Western values. Instead, Britain needs to win the hearts and minds of newcomers with the ideals of personal liberty and individualism, combating multiculturalism-induced rootlessness that can cause some to find a home in political extremism.
"My original way into theater was through reading," he says, recalling a boyhood illuminated by Joseph Heller's "Catch-22" and all of Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s books. "When I fell in love with theater it was because that was a way of making the stories I loved come alive."

If any misdeeds are limited to Dunn, then the impact will fall on Dunn rather than on Best Buy, Spieckerman said. But if the investigation determines he frequently used company funds in the pursuit of an inappropriate relationship, then "heads will have to roll," she added.
"Extending the Bush tax cuts will get about 30 cents of stimulus for each federal dollar invested, while costing the country $700 billion over the next ten years," Kaptur said. "We will have to borrow from China and Saudi Arabia to pay for these tax cuts, while Wall Street pulls record profits and the nation continues to suffer through what feels like to many a jobless recovery."

regulation was a critical mistake as it gave New York a two-man
I was glad to not have to wait long for a table, but the back seemed overly spare and isolated. I missed the comfy touches of the front room -- the picture windows, the honeyed lighting and the open kitchen, with marble counters the colors of a calico cat.
Q: Hey, Tony: Has there been any reports, good or bad, about that huge undrafted offensive lineman we picked up from Canada, Joel Reinders? He has freakish physical attributes. I'd like to see us keep him and develop him more. Could be a nice find. Joel Reinders vs. Cliff Geathers in one-on-one drills must be interesting . . . who do you think would win? -- Robert Benjamin Jr., Crestview, Fla
One of Philadelphia's great assets is a huge inventory of affordable housing, a key to our population growth. And plenty of eager investors are ready and willing to buy properties and vacant lots.

Before this game, pitching coach Dave Eiland asked Luis Mendoza what had changed since spring training. Luis pitched as well or better than anyone in Surprise, but has pitched poorly since breaking camp. Luis said he thought he had to be better to compete during a big league season. The result has been being too fine  trying to make perfect pitches on the corners. Dave Eiland told Luis to trust his stuff, pound the zone with low strikes and let hitters get themselves out.
When Assistant Senate Minority Leader Greg Brophy first sat down with Maes, it was clear the gubernatorial hopeful had done his homework.

U.S. District Court Judge Sara Lioi rejected the request Thursday, ruling that an abundance of evidence and wire-tapped conversations -- not just Russo's testimony -- resulted in McCafferty's conviction on charges she lied to the FBI.
The club is perfect through three games for the second time in its history and could start 4-0 for the first time ever with a win Sunday against Chivas USA at the Home Depot Center in Los Angeles.
He is on the right track, experts say. One big friction point in such an arrangement is how to pay the costs involved in maintaining a home—including taxes, insurance, utility bills—after the previous owner dies, says Mary Schmidt, an estate-planning attorney in Boston.
The Kings already were leading 1-0 by the time that fight took place, having taken the air out of the Blues and the building with Richards scoring only 31 seconds into the game, converting a rebound after Penner’s solid drive to the net.
A: Cash for Clunkers, the summertime government program that gave consumers up to $4,500 to trade in a clunker for a more fuel-efficient vehicle, helped many new car dealers reduce their inventories in July and August. And most car companies have cut production because of the tough economy so many consumers had less to choose from when they surveyed dealerships in October.

Within a few years, it proved to have exactly the opposite effect, driving utilities to insolvency and raising power bills for years, if not decades.
LaGace said the district has made switching to a new platform an easy step for students and teachers, including providing a way for iPad users to access the district's "cloud" to open files that are created on netbooks or teacher tablets. Each iPad will be equipped with a rubberized cover that should protect it from most drops and dings. Schools will get to choose whether the equipment stays on campus or goes home with students, he said.
So I was surprised to see the 2010 Barkan Classic Pinot Noir selling for $10.99 at the Wine and Cheese Place, 457 North New Ballas Road in Creve Coeur. The timing couldn't have been better, because pinot noir is a good wine to bring to a Passover seder, which like Thanksgiving feasts, incorporates a range of foods and flavors. Pinot noir is a versatile red that goes well with popular seder entrees such as brisket, roast chicken or salmon.
Corruption is embedded in China's unique approach to economic and political governance. When China began to experiment with capitalism in the late 20th century, many government officials became entrepreneurs. The Communist Party also encouraged local officials to compete for investment. These local officials gained enormous power, which they used to demand bribes, distribute resources and provide favors.
"Four thumbs-up," Viviana said of the ferry ride, raising her thumbs as well as her big toes.
Mammograms and colorectal screening tests are meant to screen a healthy population for conditions in which it's proved that treatments give significant benefit, i.e. longer life or better quality of life. In order for a screening test to be helpful, the patient has to live long enough to make the follow-up tests and treatments worthwhile.
That is why longtime family-practice physician Richard Baron, 58, is now a federal bureaucrat working for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in Baltimore.

Because of the program's structure, many long-term owners enjoy steep discounts on their tax bills, while recent buyers pay the full cost, the recent Sun investigation documented. One result is that wealthier residents who have owned their homes for years pay just a fraction of their annual tax bill.
Three Ohio men -- Douglas Shisler of Doylestown, Peter J. Esposito of Middleburg Heights and James L. Binge of Jackson Township in Stark County -- were charged for their roles as Cyprus Funds co-directors. Shisler and Esposito each served less than three years in federal prison and are now free. Binge died while his case was pending.
Twelve years ago, the Shackletts expanded production to a greenhouse near their home in the even more remote, isolated hamlet of Onyx, a 40-minute drive west of Ridgecrest. They closed the facility three years ago, after the price of propane skyrocketed and it became too expensive to heat it.
First, here's what it won't do: take sides, award you money if you've been harmed or return funds you've spent. And it doesn't launch inquiries into complaints it doesn't have the legal authority to look into -- those against nurses, for example.
There were teeny tostada rounds mounded high with diced raw hamachi ringing with lime aioli, pico de Gallo and chile piquin. The meatballs glazed in ancho-cranberry barbecue sauce hid the surprise of melty Oaxaca cheese inside. Tender skewered octopus were most notable for the presentation — the octo-kebab sliced into oblong coins for maximum tentacle crisp-age. The carnitas tacos were tender from their beer, Coke and orange juice braise. Chicken enchiladas came beneath an ebony shine of my new favorite mole poblano, its mysteriously blend of 25 ingredients (from mulatto chiles to hazelnuts, figs, pepitas and tomatillos) in sharper balance than Cantina’s sweeter suburban rendition.
“Why do people who wear perfume insist on using so much? For all the world to smell? When you walk into a room and the air is saturated with your choice of fragrance, do you ever think it is too overpowering? We all don’t like the same perfumes. Remember, a little will go a long way. Please consider your fellow man.”
Its an unfortunate situation, Bryant said. James, from what I hear, is OK. As far as Metta goes, he has to focus on himself, and however many games they give him, they give him. He just has to be prepared, and when he comes back, just step right in and be ready to go.

The original version ran about 4 1/2 hours; at 2 1/2 hours, the international version shown here seems a bit much. But it has commitment and style, and you can see why Woo, the noted Hong Kong action director, would want to produce it: It fits right in with his "heroic bloodshed" cinematic legacy.
That call by a speaker at the University of California, Davis, campus on Monday captures sticky First Amendment and civil disobedience issues.

Instead of getting what they're worth, the players receive athletic scholarships that don't cover the full cost of attending school, leaving many of them living below the poverty line, says the report, "The Price of Poverty in Big Time College Sport."
A year and a half later, we were ready to take a few more tentative steps (literally and figuratively) out of the studio. We wanted to dance. Out-on-the-town dance. We wanted to go to dinner at a nice restaurant and, with casual elegance, slip from our seats and glide to the dance floor. But where was there such a place?
The surface drudgery of a bad date isn't the only hazard of thoughtless matchmaking, though: It also holds insult potential when you get paired with your definition of a grasping lowlife or galloping head case.
One reporter at today's news conference wondered if Kucinich regretted not going after Kaptur more forcefully on her home turf.
"It's fine as long as it helps us to win nationals," Schmitt said. "To get to nationals is an absolute dream. They've worked so hard. They've been out doing two-a-days right now in the St. Louis summer."
The witty Youngs remains best known for the quiet, confessional "F*** was I," the lament of a woman who couldn’t stop herself from falling in love with a close friend. She may break out her acoustic guitar when she takes the stage Thursday at Maxwell’s with her three-piece band. Yet considering the propulsive sound of her "An Unwavering Band of Light" album, due out Feb. 7, attendees should expect her to rock.
"During the time we were closed, there were other businesses opened under the Burns name," Cory said. "In order to eliminate confusion, we decided to add 'Original' to our name to inform customers that we are, and always will be, the Original Burns BBQ that they know and love. We still use the same pits and the same recipes that my grandfather used."
About two thirds of Nashville’s middle-school math teachers volunteered to participate in the experiment. Half of the 296 teachers were placed randomly in a control group, while the rest were eligible for bonuses of $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000 if their pupils scored significantly higher than expected on a statewide exam.
Bales' post from March 2011, about the Army promotion, appears to have been the blog's latest entry. In it, she explained why she maintained the site in the first place. The collection of posts was a "time capsule," she wrote, and she hoped that her children would one day "enjoy reading about the decisions that Mom and Dad went through during their lives."
"It's stupid to keep these," he said. "But how many people have ashes from the 1906 earthquake?"
According to the grand jury report, Paterno testified that he referred the account relayed by the assistant to his superior. Paterno has maintained that a more detailed description of what allegedly occurred in the showers was never passed on to him.
The move comes more than a year after AmTrust's federal regulator said the bank was guilty of "unsafe and unsound banking practices," including making risky loans with no documentation of income a year after most banks had stopped such loans.
As chief judge of the Court of Appeals, Lippman presides over New York's Office of Court Administration -- with its 18,000-plus employees, $2.7 billion budget and life-and-death grip on issues of intense interest to trial lawyers everywhere.
Danny Coughlan sets the tone here with a doo-wop-flavored waltz called "I Cherish the Heartbreak More Than the Love That I Lost," which somehow manages to live up to its title, and proceeds to mope his way like the kid in a Morrissey haircut through an album packed with devastated love songs. The '60s-flavored pop gem "We're Supposed to Be in Love" finds him pining the title with total conviction, followed by "But in the very same breath we're finding different ways of breaking apart." The overall effect feels like Morrissey singing an album of singles Phil Spector was hoping to pitch to Roy Orbison, hopelessly devoted to the sound and passion of a bygone era.
So where is the doubt about Clemons' guilt?
It was not until July 2011 that Maryland's highest court, the Court of Appeals, spoke on the question of the impact of Maryland's speech or debate clause. Unfortunately, it repeated the sins of the Court of Special Appeals in the Blondes case by not taking the opportunity to give full weight to the anti-bribery provision that had been added to the Maryland Constitution in 1867.
The parents of Fee's partners, the boards of the two theaters, were intrigued but wary.
"The prospect of drilling in Ohiopyle is going to be tremendously jarring," said John Quigley, the former secretary of Pennsylvania's Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and now a consultant for the environmental group Penn Future.

But most important of all, the relationship between P-Orridge and Lady Jaye comes off as heartfelt, and "Ballad" makes you feel something. Just like art.

While Kasich blamed previous governors for over-promising funds for ODOT projects, it is worth noting that Wray previously served as ODOT's director from 1991 to 1999 under governors George Voinovich and Bob Taft. Also former Gov. Ted Strickland, when he took office in 2007, raised concerns over whether ODOT had enough money to cover planned projects.

Indeed, the "uninsured crisis" itself is properly regarded as a symptom, not a cause, of high costs. The insured consume two and a half times as much health care as the uninsured. This massive consumption is largely a result of being insured, and therefore immunized from the direct cost of health care. It's as if you paid a $10 co-pay for a tank of gas and your car insurer paid the balance. The roads would be even more congested than they are now! Further, one third to one half of this spending does not contribute to better health. The blunt fact is that most of us are overinsuredbut few of us are prepared to accept that fact, so most politicians ignore it.
Matthew Bennett, who represents Schurick, said political speech is often deceiving and that the prosecution of Schurick creates a "slippery slope" that could curtail free speech. He said he saw a campaign poster during that election that depicted O'Malley as being on a ticket with Obama — which he said was designed to trick voters into casting ballots for the incumbent governor. He said the poster was misleading because Obama wasn't running.
This week, the Liberty Towers apartment complex in Newton contacted an exterminator to battle an infestation. Last week, the AMC/Loews movie complex at Monmouth Mall closed after bedbugs were found. And in the previous week, the Somerset County Board of Social Services fumigated after bedbugs were found in its Somerville waiting room.

The war, as Mike Carey put it, left both of them maimed. The only difference is, some wounds are visible for the world to see, while some are deeply hidden.
In a report to the Metro Council, Auditor Suzanne Flynn said the regional government has plans in place to buy, stabilize and develop nature parks, but not for ongoing maintenance. Because of that, employees "filled the void with their own initiative and experience" and sometimes worked at cross purposes.
The roasted-malt character of this almost-black schwarzbier displays itself with a cocoa-powder aroma. The flavor, however, is not nearly as roasty as the color suggests. The beer's lager yeast, pilsner malt and German hops combine to create a clean-tasting beer with a crisp, dry finish. If you've been fooled by the misconception that dark equals heavy, this beer will set you straight. Available on draft at the brewery and several bars and restaurants around town. At 4.4 percent ABV, you could drink several Black Lagers on St. Patrick's Day.
He had called a special meeting for a Friday afternoon, a meeting every teacher was required to attend. However, only the district teachers would be paid. The special education teachers would not.

"It seems like the average person is getting squeezed out," he said. "The biggest issue is that every year you get a 2 percent or 3 percent raise — if you’re lucky. Even with the caps, your income can’t keep up. … Anybody that’s retiring, they’re out of here."
Exploring any link between illegal immigration and other crimes is difficult.
Thoms said he was puzzled by comments made by PBA President Ives pertaining to different police cultures in the two communities.
That would be a mistake -- at least this early in the careers of both rookies. Jamison's presence is benefiting the club, and specifically the two first-rounders. Despite a few dubious shooting nights -- notably 6-of-20 in the opener against Toronto -- he is the only other starter besides Irving creating his own shot. That can't be overstated. Take away Jamison, and Irving loses one of his best options as well as a player who can stretch the defense and create lanes for the penetrating point guard.
Children are repeatedly encased in pressurized oxygen chambers normally used after scuba diving accidents. This unproven therapy is meant to reduce inflammation that experts say is little understood and may even be beneficial.

physical characteristics. Still, we don't see the phrase "Irish-looking man" in the newspaper, though red hair and pale skin are common Irish characteristics. Would a picture come to mind if a TV anchor said, "The suspect appeared to be Italian"? Couldn't many of us conjure an image if the police said they were looking for a middle-aged man described as "Jewish-looking."

On March 19, 1997, he announced he had fumbled an election-reform vote the day before, on a measure that passed 51 to 6: "I was trying to vote yes on this, and I was recorded as a no," he said. The next day, he acknowledged voting "present" on a key telecommunications vote.
All of the language was drafted by City Attorney Christopher Crean and was submitted to the Washington County elections division on Aug. 19. The county then printed exactly what was submitted, something Pessemier called "a scrivener's error" on the part of the city.
“Ned called me into his office (earlier this week),” Francoeur said, “and had a little talk with me. He said the one thing I did so well last year was seeing pitches and backing off a little bit.
The number of kids in state custody increased from 10,515 in September 2010 to 11,682 on Oct. 31, 2011, the last day of the Department of Economic Security's most recent, and still unreleased, report on kids in care. That's an 11 percent increase. Yet DES Director Clarence Carter says he did not ask for additional funding for children in out-of-home care.
Get over the stigma. The perception that it's only the downtrodden shopping at thrift and consignment stores has all but been quashed thanks to a stubbornly stagnant economy. And shows like A&E's "Storage Wars" and the History Channel's "American Pickers" have turned that stigma into mystique, Cutler said. Bottom line: if you're going to shop thrift, swallow your pride and grab a cart.
Sarah: During lunch with Ben’s family, Lindzi was so nervous and kept dropping everything, which made me like her more. I really hope Ben doesn’t pick her because she deserves better. Ben’s sister cornered her and grilled her about Courtney rather than getting to know Lindzi better. Julia hasn’t met Courtney yet and already doesn’t like her!
Mr. Smith, who runs a trail-riding operation and captures many horses to limit the herd size and protect the newly abandoned "dumpouts" from harm, thinks there is a solution that makes many people uncomfortable: the slaughterhouse.
Also noteworthy about this Honda's power is that it's not much for towing. Buyers looking to tow more than the CR-V's 1,500-pound limit don't have the option of choosing a larger engine, as buyers of the Ford Escape or Toyota RAV-4 do.
Wenders feels a special bond with Bausch. They became friends over the years, and, both having been born in or near Dusseldorf, Germany, they could speak a Rhineland accent and enjoy their dialect.
"It's widely known that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery," said MillerCoors spokesman Julian Green. "But there's only one originator in this category, and that's MGD 64."
"The enormous success we've achieved over the past seven years was made possible by the people of St. Louis, and we've been blessed in ways we never could have imagined," the statement read.

Whatever happens to Apple's bookstore, customers should still be able to read e-books on the company's devices. While Forrester says that slightly more than half of iPad owners say they use the device to read books, many do so on third-party iPad apps like the Kindle app.
Having Bush to attack has been convenient for both groups. The tea party movement says its roots are in a rebellion against the Bush administration's increased deficits and bailout of Wall Street firms. This has allowed its members -- people who generally voted for Bush twice and then McCain in 2008 -- to cast themselves as independent from the GOP.
Former Justice Peter Verniero, who listened to nearly two hours of arguments in the gallery, acknowledged the pressure the justices will face in ruling on a judicial matter, but said they are used to deciding high profile, controversial cases.

The South Jersey Democrat also introduced a bill mirroring Christie’s call to end payouts to retiring public employees for unused sick days. And when Sweeney vowed to "take seriously" the leak of confidential questionnaires filled out by two Supreme Court nominees, Christie gushed.
Sun Peaks isn't widely known outside British Columbia, but it should be. In B.C., it is second in size only to Whistler and has the country's third biggest skiable area, 3,678 acres of diverse terrain including alpine bowls, glade skiing, snowboard parks, groomed cross-country trails and backcountry routes. Spread across three mountains are 121 downhill runs up to five miles long. Sun Peaks also has the biggest vertical drop (2,891 feet) in interior B.C. And all of that is bathed in 2,000 hours of annual sunshine, which gives the area its name.
Time and again the shot-clock would tick off to the final seconds only to see a Panther rise up and knock one down. On four straight possessions late in the first half, Kent's defense stymied Pitt for --most of the 35-second shot-clock, and the Panthers scored all four times, twice as the buzzer sounded. That turned a 25-22 Pitt lead into a 36-27 lead.
Employers pulled back sharply on hiring last month, a reminder that the U.S. economy may not be growing fast enough to sustain robust job growth. The unemployment rate dipped, but mostly because more Americans stopped looking for work.
Apache governance was thrown into chaos four months ago when a majority of Tribal Council members voted to suspend Lupe for alleged misconduct. Among the allegations: failure to carry out resolutions, improper appointment of a chief judge and interference with tribal-housing operations.

Leiken and council members cited far-reaching budget cuts enacted by the state Legislature, most notably the Estate Tax, which is used for capital improvements, debt service and economic development initiatives.
Jack White is on stage, presently with the Dead Weather, who play the Roseland on Sunday, but before that with the Raconteurs, and before that with the White Stripes.

Such pettifogging laws reflect, aside from the joy governments derive from bossing people around, the current rage for regulating political speech lest . . . what? Campaign regulations usually focus on money, supposedly to prevent quid pro quo corruption or the appearance thereof pertaining to candidates. But many laws cover activities involving ballot measures, which suggests that for reformers, limiting political speech is itself the goal. Hence their obsession with political money, most of which funds the dissemination of speech.

Creme brulee. Once the cream is heated, add flavorings like coffee, lavender, or savories such as butternut squash. Cover the pot, turn off the heat and allow the cream to infuse for at least 10 to 20 minutes. For stronger flavors, Citizen Cake's Elizabeth Falkner suggests an additional step: Leave the flavoring in the cream, cool, cover and store overnight in the refrigerator before straining and reheating. For a perfect creme brulee that is creamy and delicate, it is imperative to not over mix or over bake it. Baking should always be done in a water bath to allow even cooking and to prevent a crust from forming.

øA: The ECB changed what could be collateral for the European banks, which is important. They made what a bank can use as collateral much wider, and they put unlimited use of three-year lending. It was a huge move, much bigger than the market reaction we saw. It's possible that this one thing has removed all funding issues for the big European banks. It gives them breathing room and can help support asset prices in the meantime. The European banks are still being forced to raise capital and by that, they still have to sell assets. They're being forced to sell assets to raise even more capital at precisely the wrong time. It's not a massive amount, but you're starting to see assets for sale, loans for sale. It's tough. You can't do a good job for shareholders raising capital with huge discounts for some assets.

I think he definitely missed me, and I missed not playing with him. With his speed and my size, and our understanding, it makes it a lot easier for him to do what he can do.

Gasco's version of empanadas ($7.25) is unusual; they're more like pressed sandwiches cut into triangles.

Hales: Well, I'm interested in continuing this regional effort of building partnerships. And that's something I'm good at. I've done it before. I've been very involved in building across the whole metropolitan area about things, whether it was about the urban growth boundary or building a transit system. For example, when I was involved in the transit agenda, we really helped the mayor of Hillsboro and her advocacy to get light rail to not just stop in Beaverton but all the way out to Hillsboro. Look at the effect of that with Nike and Intel and other folks on the line. So the same thing goes for the arts. Part of what I can bring is credibility in the whole region, and a belief that we are an organic region that needs to work together. And the arts is one of these areas where I'll continue to call on the rest of the region to step up and help with arts funding and support arts in all of the schools. I'm sure we'll talk about that when we get to talk about funding measures. There are school districts that are partly in Portland and partly not. The Centennial School District, for instance. Well, all of those kids ought to have access to arts in their daily life and as part of their curriculum in school. We need to think beyond the city limits and that's the important theme of that whole effort.

Hey, Tony: What are the chances the front office is second-guessing their decision on Shurmur? His offense is the second-worst in the NFL, his play-calling does not even come close to playing to the strengths of what "talent" he does have, he stubbornly sticks with rookie guards when they have made mistake after mistake, his inconsistent lineups have ticked off or alienated Hillis and Cribbs, the team's two best (only two) playmakers, and his love affair with Hardesty has left a "Braylon Edwards" amount of drops snuffing out drives. -- Chris Zanon, Canton

Ms. Newhouse is no stranger to Europe's most revered classical concert halls, like Vienna's Musikverein and Amsterdam's Concertgebouw, and the grand 19th-century European opera houses. But as an architectural historian with an equal interest in the past and the present, she has made a particular study of new construction in the U.S. Because she understands the nature and necessity of social, technological and architectural change, she goes beyond conventional architectural criticism and acoustical analysis to outspoken criticism of the results. And she has come to some surprising conclusions.

Canada has offered to pay $550 million in advance to cover Michigan's share of the project and be paid back through bridge tolls. Snyder and bridge supporters say Michigan taxpayers would be insulated from any shortfall in bridge revenues by ironclad legislation.
But some experts warn that stability might be threatened if current trends continue.
The first walk begins on an all-dirt trail at an easy grade and then joins a steep and sometimes slippery trail that provides a view of several waterfalls. The second walk is on a dirt trail to the Mitchell Canyon Visitor Center through a native plant garden. Walkers may choose 5K or 10K routes for both walks.
And while some have Hightower falling to the San Francisco 49ers or Baltimore Ravens, I’m not buying that either. I think he’s gone before that. And if not, the two teams I just mentioned will snatch him up.

A musical producer is to a recording, what a director is to a movie.
Beldini, a 75-year-old Democrat, was convicted on two of the six corruption counts she faced following a two-week trial in January and, under sentencing guidelines, faced up to four years and three months in jail. The one-time burlesque dancer sat silently during most of Monday's hearing, wearing a white jacket, a black skirt and pearl earrings. Moments before Linares announced her sentence, Beldini told the judge she had never been so afraid. "I stand before you facing the most terrifying moment of my whole life," Beldini said, her voice shaking.
"It would be tragic if any woman — let alone thousands of women — lost access to these potentially lifesaving screenings because of a politically motivated attack," the senators wrote.
Since then, Weinstein's organization, the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, has battled the military in what Weinstein called in an interview last week "blood sport."
"London Boulevard," starring Colin Farrell and Keira Knightley, is a pitch-black thriller with ruthless drug bosses and relentless paparazzi sharing bad guy billing. Would that the movie were pitch perfect as well.
After nearly 90 years of offering employment and training to thousands of struggling residents, Goodwill Industries of Greater Detroit last year spun off a nonprofit subsidiary, Green Works, aimed at keeping hazardous materials out of landfills.

Most of the mint sold at American grocers is spearmint or peppermint, just two of the many varieties (that grow like weeds) available. It should have a mix of large and small leaves that are bright green and firm.

His rhetoric aside, Bloomberg seems hesitant to insist on that. Instead, he's called for a number of piddling reforms to let the city manage its own affairs -- overseeing its own tax collection, for example, or buying supplies, free of state rules. All fine, but not close to closing the mammoth gaps.
In fact, poll after poll reveals that the public considers jobs to be the subject their elected officials should address.

In Argentina, the Roadblock required one team member to jump out of an airplane and the other team member to drive to a marked location to meet up. The non-jumping sister turned her car off the road at the wrong spot and got stuck in some deep sand. She had to wait for friendly locals to drive past and tow her car out. If not for the friendly locals, they would have lost the race right there.
Though “Mad Men” secured the Golden Globe for best drama, Showtime’s “Dexter,” about a creepily moral serial killer, scored two acting awards, one for star Michael C.

Obama told Rolling Stone magazine that he did not believe Romney would be able to disavow the conservative positions he took during the primaries.
Spicy beef soup is fun to eat, with long strings of beef, noodles and slender sprouts wrapping around each other in a pleasant confusion. Seasoned broiled black cod is warming and excellent; the flavors of cod and fermented soy paste form a sort of dense nectar, which the chunks of daikon soak up like a sponge.
"We strongly support our son and all the troops," said Linda.
"There’s only so much excitement you can pack into one day," he said. "The effort is to capture business early on the assumption people will come back and buy more. They’ll forget they bought something or because they’ve had it for so long, it won’t be as special, so they feel they have to get one more thing."
Sorkin and the other filmmakers are clearly aware that Mezrich's book has become something of a liability for the film and are now distancing themselves from the work. "I know this is how Facebook is pushing back against the movie," said Sorkin. "Nothing in the movie has been invented for the sake of Hollywood-izing it or sensationalizing."

"You can't take a substantive policy decision like congressional maps and attach a few bucks to them and think you could get around the will of the people," said Redfern. "We have the capacity to collect the necessary signatures to place this on the ballot, and we will."
This seems to be the year for passion projects for the director. His energetic documentary "Pearl Jam Twenty" indulged his love of rock music, and now "Zoo" celebrates his love of family. Though neither movie reaches the level of Crowe's standout films — the autobiographical intimacy he achieved in 2000's "Almost Famous," which earned him a screenwriting Oscar, or the what-makes-Sammy-run electricity of 1996's "Jerry Maguire" — "Zoo" is definitely one from the heart.
Credentials in hand, I soon thereafter checked in for The Heart Truth Red Dress fashion show. I go to the show for kicks, not the fashions. The purpose is to bring awareness to the perils of heart disease, but the perks include sitting across the aisle from Susan Sarandon (she looked a little like she woke up recently and dressed ultra casual in a well-worn preppy pink Polo) and Johnny Weir (who wore very sparkly pants and gloves).
"It was really exciting watching it ," said Daisy Lee, 14, of Paterson, who came with her family to celebrate Father's Day with her dad Leo, a big fan of the sport who dreamed of being a pilot himself.

For many years, the couple has had a cocktail hour ritual. While White cooks, Smith surprises her with a drink — a margarita, a martini, whatever. He used to give her the cocktail to sip while preparing dinner and then retreat to the computer. But White recently asked him to stay with her in the kitchen.
A wide receiver in football, Grimes has been invited to the University of Illinois football camp combine next month.
So the next time we see the pair, they’re 23, and the injuries are more serious. By now, Doug believes Kayleen has special healing powers to heal the eye he has blown out with a firework. Kayleen, preparing for her unsupportive father’s funeral in the morning by drinking herself blurry and driving her car off the road, calls him a “freak” and a “crackhead” instead.
Houston’s family rejected a public spectacle for a final farewell to the pop icon, choosing instead to hold a private, invitation-only funeral at New Hope, the singer’s childhood church, which seats about 1,500. The Rev. Joe A. Carter, pastor at New Hope Baptist Church, said he will officiate the service, which is scheduled to begin at noon. Houston was born in Newark and raised in East Orange.
The claim: Suzanne Kosmas is no moderate. She's a Nancy Pelosi "liberal Democrat." This is one of Adams' favorite claims. But it's a stretch. The widely respected National Journal described Kosmas one of the 10 most moderate members of the entire U.S. House. Kosmas sided with Republicans on everything from estate taxes to opposing high-profile pork in Democratic districts. OpenCongress.org said she voted with John Boehner 58 percent of the time. Kosmas is certainly more liberal than most Republicans. But anyone trying to portray her as a flaming lefty is being disingenuous.
Still, possessing a live Snakehead is against the law, punishable by a fine of up to $500, depending on previous offenses.
øAs Rick shared, "My partner had moved on with his life. But there I was left stewing, hurt and bitter. I allowed him to determine my mood and my happiness. I let him play a role in whether I'd attend a meeting I thought he might be at. I'd wake up hating him while he was probably waking up thinking, 'Should I have Corn Flakes or Cheerios?' "
Chesnut said that the disease is wide-reaching enough to welcome any effort to raise awareness, even if it shuns pink for stark images in black and white.
The handwritten note, received by District Judge Daniel Mabley just before the verdicts were presented last week, said: "Can this be read in the courtroom in front of Ms. Senser? We believe, she believed she hit a car or vehicle and not a person."
On the surface, the minimum benefits requirement does seem to mandate comprehensive coverage. But another provision of the law works in the opposite direction, and the two have to be weighed together.
When the Zafars began building the house, they had some ideas of what they wanted. "An open floor plan was important to us," says Sajid, "and a first-floor master bedroom."

The replay showed the ball was out.
To be sure, not every store was filled to the brim with people looking for deals on Black Friday. With so many major stores opening at midnight, crowds shopped early, staying up late to snag the best deals. That meant there was an unusual lull during the typically bustling pre-dawn hours when stores used to open their doors.
For a while after Sullivan leaves, the relationship continues via frequent letters. Camille follows his progress with pins on a wall map of South America, a situation that is not fated to last, though that doesn't make its ending any less of a jolt.
On spending, the measure generally consists of relatively small adjustments to thousands of individual programs. Agencies like the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement would get a boost within the Homeland Security Department, while GOP defense hawks won additional funding to modernize the U.S. nuclear weapons arsenal. The troubled, over-budget, next-generation F-35 fighter plane program would be largely protected.

About three weeks ago, Mashia-Jones was again in New Orleans, where she lived until she was 8 before moving to Portland. Approximately 25 family members were in attendance for the Southeastern Conference tournament when Vanderbilt stunned the Wildcats in the final, just Kentucky's second loss of the season.
The headmaster, the Rev. Michael Brunner, said in a statement that Brandon was the last runner in the pack and that a coach trailed about 10 feet behind when Brandon stumbled and fell into the road.
Kazmi, 52, of Rochester Hills, sat quietly until his case was called Thursday afternoon in U.S. District Court in downtown Detroit. He said little and offered no plea when federal Magistrate R. Steven Whalen agreed to a prosecution request to limit his travel to southeastern Michigan. Whalen set a $10,000 bond for Kazmi and ordered him to continue the treatment he has been receiving for mental health issues.
We realize there are further debates to be had about the exact terms and language of the amendment. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, for instance, does favor such an amendment but wants a 35-year residency requirement for naturalized citizens; Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Corona) would require individuals to have been a citizen for a quarter of a century. But it's remarkable that 18 out of 55 members failed to get back to us on this issue altogether, three refused to comment and 11 others couldn't muster a simple "yes" or "no" answer to these fundamental questions. These include both Democratic senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. Feinstein reminded us that she had serious concerns about such an amendment the last time the issue was looked at by the Senate Judiciary Committee, but that she would keep an open mind on future proposals. Boxer simply said she'd want to look at the specific language of any proposed amendment before taking a position, but she wouldn't even answer the first question regarding Schwarzenegger's predicament.
"It has got to be central, that's a function of downtown," he said. "You wouldn't want to eliminate that function at the core of the region."
In its motion, the ACLU noted concerns about how the state would collect, store and protect the personal information that people would be required to present under the new standards. They also cited the likely "substantial costs" of implementing the new standards, and said many people — such as domestic violence victims, homeless people and Americans who were born in other countries — would likely face new, major hurdles in getting or renewing licenses.
The counties west of Asheville and south of Great Smoky Mountains National Park are famous for their aquatic cascades -- some powerful, some puny, all a result of the region's dramatic elevation variations and high rainfall.
Kroeger: This is so over the top. We’ve got this flying stage that comes down and picks us up and takes us across the arena and starts spinning ... it’s just absolute insanity. We’ve got this massive screen that splits apart in six different sections, and we’ve got these ... conveyor belts that transport us from parts of the stage.
"Right now, the residents have no trust," Pippin said. "Morale is low in the county. I have no faith in them whatsoever."
By late October and early November, when the 2009-2010 novel H1N1 vaccine became widely available, the virus was spreading quickly throughout Europe and North America. As a result, many patients were likely exposed to the virus after getting the vaccine but before their bodies were able to mount an immune response -- a process that takes at least two weeks. That timing hitch may have driven down the vaccine's apparent effectiveness, said Lone Simonsen, an epidemiologist with George Washington University and an expert on influenza, in an interview Tuesday.
Paterno certainly had detractors, as well. One former Penn State professor called his high-minded words on academics a farce. He was criticized for making broad critiques about the wrongs in college football without providing specifics. A former administrator said his players often got special treatment compared to non-athletes. His coaching style often was considered too conservative. Some thought he held on to his job too long. There was a push to move him out in 2004 but it failed.

Hot flashes are perhaps the best-known symptom of menopause. The occurrence of hot flashes varies in frequency and intensity from person to person and over time. They can be severe and frequent enough to interfere with daily activities and even with sleep. When this is the case, women may seek relief in the form of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). In general, the current practice is to use the lowest effective dose of HRT to relieve symptoms and to use it for the least amount of time necessary.

(05-10) 13:01 PDT New York (AP) --
Shumpert hurt his knee in the third quarter of Game 1 in the Knicks' first-round Eastern Conference Playoff series with the Heat. The combo guard was particularly useful to interim coach Mike Woodson for his defensive presence against Miami's Dwyane Wade, not to mention his ability to handle the basketball in the absence of Jeremy Lin, who is out because of a torn meniscus in his left knee.
Marini's, which sells 19 flavors of saltwater taffy as well as caramel apples and homemade fudge, is now run by Joseph Marini III, 34, whose great-grandfather Victor started out with a popcorn cart on the boardwalk in 1915. As a kid, Marini used to sweep the floor of the candy store.
"I applaud Edgar for his ability to develop the cultural capital for … the project. If it comes to communication with funders and the art world about the project, I'd give him an A+," said Lowe, founder of Project Row Houses in Houston. "But when it comes to internal stuff, how he's been able to use the project as a way to access the potential of the existing community, that's a different story."

Snapvine: The company lets people post personalized voice comments to their MySpace pages. It has raised more than $2 million from Draper Fisher Jurvetson and other investors.
His opinion is entitled to change, but if Booker is labeling Vanderbeek “one of the most despicable owners” in the NHL, we’ll just assume he’s too busy tweeting to keep up with the league. One team (Atlanta) moved last season (to Winnipeg), another (Nashville) is constantly threatening to do the same and yet another (Phoenix) doesn’t even have an owner. The NHL is running the team.

“I think the whole idea of these PACs becoming larger than the campaigns themselves is a very bad idea,” he said. “I just don’t like the way the law is, but we certainly follow the law as it exists to make sure that we’re not at a disadvantage in getting our message out.”
In the latest quarter, Lipitor revenue fell 42 percent to $1.4 billion, mainly due to a 71 percent plunge in the U.S. However, CEO Frank D'Amelio said in an interview that U.S. market share was "was 2 1/2 times higher than what we would have expected" without the deals.

Yes. Tom Welter, executive director of the Oregon School Activities Association, said that as long as the schools control the programs, they can still participate in existing leagues and playoffs. Money raised by parents or boosters could simply be channeled through the district to operate them, regardless of the source, he said.
Funny, he said, how many of them were 1 irons. There was the shot at Pebble Beach that helped him hold off Bruce Crampton. There was also another 1 iron at Augusta National, with Tom Weiskopf and Johnny Miller pressuring him, that led to his Masters victory in 1975.
With one of the board's two Democratic members absent, the two Republicans cast the votes naming Lynch, then a Republican Borough Councilman in Milford, to the post. He succeeded Republican Charles Thorne of Franklin Township, who retired.

On the field, Tressel was indisputably a great coach. He was 9-1 against Michigan. It was a Christmas present record, only to be dreamed of before him, a vision dancing like sugar plums in Ohio State fans' heads.
So why haven't you seen "Brokeback Mountain" yet? The "Brokeback Mountain" phenomenon has become as unavoidable as a military recruiter at a continuation school. You can't turn on the television without seeing a gay cowboy, every theater seems to be playing the picture and each day seems to bring a new shopping cart full of awards for the movie -- including eight Oscar nominations this week. It's hard to find a straight man who has seen the movie and regrets it.
Authorities, on the other hand, say Lowson and his co defendants used 100,000 internet protocol addresses, hundreds of e-mails and other modern tricks to commit old-fashioned fraud and hide the fact that the tickets were bought by a single company instead of individual fans.
Dear Margo: I am a couponer who has been lucky to stockpile expensive products. My question concerns my coupons and etiquette. Is it acceptable to use items from my stockpile as gifts? For example, a friend of the family is having a baby. They are struggling financially, and the husband was laid off soon after the wife found out she was pregnant. In lieu of a gift I asked the woman to come over and "shop" at my house. I wanted to help cut their expenses so the money they do have can be used for other things. Since I have every thing from cleaning supplies to personal hygiene items to baby wipes, I thought it more prudent to help with everyday items, rather than buy, say, baby clothes. Do you think this is appropriate? I do not want to come off as cheap. The woman will be taking home more than $250 in products that are the best name-brand items. Because of the coupons, though, I only paid about $20 for it all. I also make gift baskets of full size and sample-sized matching items from the stockpile. What do you think of this? — Coupon Crazy in Kansas City

Private Empire, by Steve Cool. The Pulitzer winner turns his investigative eye toward ExxonMobil, one of the most notoriously secretive companies in the world.
It seemed every time Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sneezed, the price for a barrel of oil would escalate. Even though the daily market values were for "future" delivery, the cost of gasoline would jump immediately. Why?

The court's four liberal justices all seemed friendly toward the law, while two conservative justices—Mr. Scalia and Samuel Alito—left little doubt they would vote against it. Justice Clarence Thomas remained silent, as is his custom, but his prior writings suggest little sympathy for the government's position.
U.S. District Judge Garr M. King sentenced Lafayette F. Keaton on Tuesday to six months' confinement by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, followed by six months of house arrest. It was unclear whether Keaton, who is in poor physical health, would serve the first term in a halfway house or a prison facility.

In the debate so far, many of the arguments have been based on rhetoric, not fact. It is important to remember that efforts to maximize judicial "independence" from the electorate can also maximize independence from the law and the Constitution. Without a mechanism for effectively holding judges accountable, judges are free to "go rogue" and make decisions based solely on their political views. Is that better than a campaign season every now and then?
However, electric vehicles tend to reduce oil consumption in nearly all regions, the group said.
The patrols begin with a call to the police precinct to get the names of the officers on duty. A typical patrol lasts about two hours.
The Newman Farm Pork 2 Ways has been on the menu since the restaurant opened. I recently tasted iteration No. 15, a lustrous citrus-juniper brined pork rib eye and a tender shoulder braised in a concoction of house-made sweet vermouth and sumac-infused bourbon with toasty notes.
The U.S. relationship with China is "very important," he added, "so we're going to make sure that we do this in the appropriate way and the appropriate balance is struck."
The pope's speech went to the heart of a pastoral challenge for church leaders presented with faithful Catholics in unhappy marriages: how to allow an individual Catholic another chance at marriage in the church (charity), while upholding the church's belief in the permanence of marriage (justice).
Women are becoming more lethal. In jihadist organizations — including even Al Qaeda, which had long banned females from violent roles — women are increasingly taking part in terrorist actions.
What really made The Plain Dealer happy, and the readers happy, and the athletes happy, was having Dugan's art available to all of us.
Location, location, location: That motto applies not only to real estate but to theater. Tennessee Williams' one-act play "Green Eyes" may be slight, but staging it in an actual hotel room -- where it's set -- for just 14 spectators packs a wallop.
The measure, sponsored by Rep. Paul Tonko, Democrat of New York, aims to ensure that massive wind-generating turbines -- some with blades spanning 100 yards -- can be more cost effective in harnessing power from the wind.

The affected chips aren't the main processors, which are based on the so-called "Sandy Bridge" technology that Intel announced in January, but a support chip. The flaw means it may degrade with use over a period of months or years, slowing down the transfer of data to and from the computer's hard drives and DVD drives.
2010 Testarossa Dos Rubios Vineyard Santa Lucia Highlands Chardonnay ($39; 14.1%): The inaugural release of the Don Rubios bottling is rich and ripe, but balanced; well-behaved and showing some elegance for its age. A hint of vanilla and toasted grain, then a silky palate of lemony tree fruit. The 2010 Testarossa Santa Cruz Mountains Chardonnay ($32; 14.1%) has a brighter, sharper edge.
After the Bears selected Major Wright and Chris Conte in the last two drafts, the club selected Brandon Hardin of Oregon State in the third round with the 79th overall pick.

Union leaders are locked in a battle with city budget negotiators, who recently asked city workers to give up pay raises scheduled for the fiscal year that begins July 1. Union representatives have refused to reopen contract talks, saying their members, who in recent years have agreed to help fund pension reform and a money-saving early-retirement program in exchange for the raises, have given enough.

Only the city manager, Bonaparte, can fire Lee or ask for his resignation, and he gave no indication he planned to do so. But as speaker after speaker, black and white, took to the microphone to question why Zimmerman had not been arrested, it was clear that Bonaparte faced pressure that showed no sign of diminishing.

"I don't think ever since I've been a head coach, and I guess that's 12 years now, I've been like, 'Man, we're going to win Meramec,'" Walsh said. "It's just too hard to win it. We have bigger goals, but I've never made that one of ours because it's such a challenge. ... That's a tournament that I can remember going to when I was a boy and watching teams play. It's still kind of mind-blowing."

When Minnesota Bank and Trust opened in Edina in 2008, CEO Kate Kelly was determined to make it a place people wanted to work.
The Tigers (16-5) have dropped games to teams from Memphis, Chicago and New Orleans. But when the McCluer Comets eked out a 60-58 win, it marked the first time since last year's season opener against University City at the Borgia Tournament that Soldan was beaten by a team that resides within St. Louis County. Borgia, of course, has two wins against the Tigers in the Class 4 semifinals the past two seasons, but that school is in Franklin County.
A man in Baltimore shipped down 70 boxes of stuffed animals. Miller's Ale Houses throughout the region agreed to start collecting donations.
So you're British, and you're ticked off that the mayor of London, currently up for re-election, is refusing to debate opponents. How do you express your distaste with this? Why, you dress in a chicken suit and chase a mayor lookalike around town. And you make it clear that this will keep happening until the mayor caves. Personally, we like this approach way better than the junk mail attack ads we get in this country.
Lapierre tied it with 1 minute 27 seconds to go as he whacked the puck near the Anaheim blue line and the puck went in off Ducks winger Sheldon Brookbank's glove as he tried to block the shot.
Can anyone disagree that far too many residents in Central Indiana have put themselves at serious risk because they smoke, weigh too much and don't exercise enough?
They're wrong. The abandonment of the case management system is a barely tolerable defeat — not for one side or the other in some obscure struggle for control between local trial courts and central administration, but for Californians who are entitled to, and have been paying for, a judicial system that serves their needs with modern facilities and accessible, up-to-date technology.
He’s a good-looking actor and a talented chameleon (going, in a few years, from playing the starving Bobby Sands of “Hunger” to action heroes in “Inglourious Basterds” and “Centurion.”) But he’s safe here. Rochester’s self-loathing needs to be scarier, his passion more fiery. (What a great part this would have been for Clive Owen.)

Square Books was my first stop in Oxford. I walked east on Van Buren Avenue from the 5 Twelve Bed & Breakfast, passing the Old Venice Pizza Co., once the site of Devoe's Gathright-Reed Drug Co., whose lending library Faulkner frequented a century ago. For years, Gathright-Reed was one of the few places in town to sell Faulkner's books; until relatively late in his career, Faulkner was largely disregarded in Oxford, referred to as "Count No-Count" for his aloofness and his apparent aversion to hard work. This, of course, was not merely a local perspective: Before the 1946 publication of "The Portable Faulkner," which collected and contextualized his writing, most of his books were out of print.

With spring ending and summer beginning, baseball and other sports activities are in full swing for many of our kids. And in some circles, youth sports get a bad rap. It is true that sometimes the balance between just being a kid and becoming the next professional athlete can get thrown out of whack.

Initially Pressman wanted the second type of fry on the menu to be a sweet potato fry, but Silverton says that they quickly realized they had never had a sweet potato fry that they really liked. In the process of searching for an alternative, Silverton gained inspiration from two New York restaurants, Jonathan Waxman's Barbuto and April Bloomfield's the Breslin, both of which feature broken and fried potato chunks. Waxman's are peeled and served with roast chicken, and Bloomfield's are cooked in duck fat.

Even though spinal stenosis is caused by arthritis in the back, back pain is not the most common symptom. People with spinal stenosis most often notice pain in the buttocks, along with weakness, numbness or pain in their legs when they stand, walk or try to lie flat. The symptoms generally go away when they sit or bend over because those positions move the arthritic joints away from the nerves, increasing space in the canal.

The legislation, which also seeks to head off an automatic cut in Medicare reimbursements to doctors, is less generous than a version that Obama and congressional Democrats have championed. The newer measure would be financed by cutting federal workforce salaries, requiring higher earning elderly people to pay more for Medicare and raising some federal fees. But it ignores the higher taxes on the rich that Democrats would use to cover the costs of their proposal.
"Hoiles displayed that rare mixture of principle and worldly practicality" which was necessary to transmit his ideas to literally millions of newspaper readers over the course of several decades.

The national debt has grown significantly in recent years and it keeps rising at this very moment. The way that people get into debt is from spending and I believe that the U.S. has been spending too much. I am not very involved with politics or with the government, but from what I have seen, the U.S. is spending a great deal of money on useless things. I think it is time for major spending cuts. They need to start using their spending money to repay all the countries they have borrowed from in the past. If the spending does not stop, then the U.S. will continue to go further in to debt. With out all the useless spending, the U.S. can save some of that money to pay off the debt that has grown significantly. They can start to pay it off slowly, but a little at a time is better than nothing. I am just a high school student so I understand that my knowledge of economics is basic. However, this is the only solution that makes sense to me.

While her husband served as president, Betty Ford's comments weren't the kind of genteel, innocuous talk expected from a first lady, and a Republican one no less. Her unscripted comments sparked tempests in the press and dismayed President Gerald Ford's advisers, who were trying to soothe the national psyche after Watergate. But to the scandal-scarred, Vietnam-wearied, hippie-rattled nation, Mrs. Ford's openness was refreshing.

While the Rams weren't happy with the end result Tuesday night, Small has his sights firmly set on the big picture. No, he doesn't like to lose. But in the midst of a tough five-game stretch he's seeing the things he wants out of his team.

But this isn't a big problem for larger animals. With comparatively less surface area in relation to the size of their bodies, they are able to retain heat much more effectively. Fur or hair thus becomes less necessary, and perhaps, in warmer climes, even a little uncomfortable. It's not a hard-and-fast rule, but it is a strong tendency, one that should hold for feathers as well.
• Yellowjackets aren't very likable and account for at least 90 percent of "bee stings." European paper wasps are often mistaken for wasps or yellowjackets, but are actually beneficial predators of caterpillars and other insects. Both take up residence in yards, so use traps for yellowjackets (they don't work for paper wasps or hornets). Eliminate favorite nesting sites like hollowed-out areas. Insecticides are effective on active nests, but apply at night or early morning. More at ext.colostate.edu/pubs/ insect/05525.html

Mostly, however, Bastianich's stories make him sound like a jerk. He says Mexicans are the hardest-working restaurant employees but Ecuadorians and Peruvians generally have "more culinary aptitude."

But remember that resentment is powerful fuel for political movements, and the fires of backlash are still burning on the American right. The challenge for women (and their male allies) is to hold up a mirror to the real America — where the vast majority of women want and, at key points in their lives, use birth control — and to expose the phony arguments and bogus values of the party that would deny them that right.

The interior is more impressive than you'd expect. However, I'm still looking for the story behind the Pinocchio emblazoned on a mirror downstairs and on a mural above the upstairs bar, where he appears to be stuffed in the attic.

And what's the picture in the last one?

My aunt gave me this sofa 30 years ago. She told me that it came from the Hollenden House hotel in downtown Cleveland.

The town and the Traer Creek Metropolitan District signed a settlement "term sheet" in October of last year. That document set a path to end litigation that began in 2009, and avoided a trial that was set to begin Oct. 31 of last year.

Wornum was also vulnerable because earlier in the season, he had taken a strategic risk, and chose to send two of his teammates, Jay and Jennifer, to the rival Red Team. His thinking, he says, was to send the strong Jay-and-Jennifer team away because he believed Jay was planning to send Wornum, his father, or Black Team leader Marci home.

Think about this. Barnes & Noble—a company that is, ahem, hardly in the forefront of technological innovation—has managed to put together a pretty good Android tablet from scratch in short order, and is selling it for $250 (and even less if, like me, you catch a promotion). It's not a top-of-the-range model, but it does include a superb screen—and analysts will tell you that's typically one of the most expensive parts of a tablet.

As is often the case in public debates this conversation seems anchored mostly in volume, meaning it's about who can scream the loudest? There is little useful or dispassionate reflection on what this debate is about: religious freedom, religious diplomacy, private property and what it means to cry fire in a crowded theater when that theater is a nation at a crossroads.
Much to my surprise, the Port Authority media office told me it shouldn't be a problem. They added that there was no rush because construction slowed at about the 90th floor; it was something I didn't really understand that has to do with the building's mechanicals. When I didn't hear from them for a couple of weeks, I called back and was assured I hadn't been forgotten. It was just really windy up there, I was told, even on calm days down below. I should be ready for a call on 24 hours' notice. I certainly understood. As much as I coveted the view, I had no interest in becoming airborne.
One of them puts his jumbo cup and a backpack on the side farthest from the lifeguard shack. He looks around furtively, grabs a can of Bud Light from the bag and pours it into his cup, using his body as a shield from prying eyes.

As the Cardinals prep for the start of Grapefruit League games Monday at Roger Dean Stadium, they figure to see a much more reliable and gifted defense in the field. Furcal returns on a two-year deal to start at shortstop. Jay is set to start in center with former Gold Glove winner Carlos Beltran in right. Freese feels more agile in the field another year removed from ankle surgery. It's possible the Cardinals will improve or maintain defensive skill in at least seven of the eight fielding positions.
Of the projects the House and Senate added, Ehrhart said, “At least we’re providing educational opportunity for Georgia’s children instead of statues of peanuts and mules. I don’t think human nature lends itself to taking politics out of every situation.

Those sums pale beside the largest dues deal that Hodgson found: Comerica paid $202,928, including an initiation fee, for CEO Ralph Babb to join a club in Dallas. Babb, incidentally, is a former St. Louisan; he once worked for Mercantile Bank. Comerica received a cash infusion from the U.S. Treasury's TARP program, and TARP requires recipients to have a "luxury expenditures policy." Apparently, though, it doesn't require them to quit paying for luxuries.

Typically, a bad offensive start in an Arena Football League game is crippling.
Hey, Ted: Flynn must be thoroughly evaluated. Here's what I don't like about him: 1. His size and arm strength are not much different from McCoy's. 2. I'm not sure how much he can lift a mediocre team -- a requirement of a true franchise quarterback. I believe his surrounding cast has lifted him. 3. You just never know how a backup will react when he is elevated to the starting job and all the responsibility falls on him. These concerns don't disqualify him, in my opinion, but allaying them would take a lot of research. I do agree if the Browns could find their quarterback outside the draft, they could really make some hay in the draft developing a supporting cast.

"And to get that done this season is a masterful job, because every coach I've talked to, except maybe Pop, has been frustrated about not having enough time to coach, figure out a rhythm of confidence. I would give San Antonio a little more of an edge because of how they're coached. They're strong, smart and fundamentally sound. And those things win in playoff basketball."
Sowell seemed strained to remember. He often leaned forward in his chair, resting his elbows on his knees, then would spring to an upright position when a detail occurred to him. He threw out vague memories of women’s clothing - fancy jeans, a light blue jacket. He remembered a few names, too.

It never gets to a vote in the Democrat-led Senate.
"And this is a point I want to emphasize." The president said. "If you buy a car, your investment in a more fuel-efficient vehicle, as a result of this standard, will pay off in just three years. .

Another major component of Monday, published on the cover each week, is a profile of a CEO or other newsmaking executive from the Chicago area.

Indeed, Butler has been getting the job done — with Howard playing a crucial role in each tournament win.

That infusion will not last. Most of the money received by the Sports Authority from Xanadu -- $160 million -- has now been spent, with only about $15 million left to offset future budget shortfalls.

Like the beautiful October afternoon in 1989, when the San Francisco Giants were playing the Oakland Athletics in the World Series. And then, out of nowhere, came an earthquake. It caused the Cypress Structure of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland to pancake and caused a big fire in San Francisco's Marina district. Brick buildings collapsed in San Francisco, Santa Cruz and Watsonville. The earthquake lasted only 15 seconds, but it killed 63 people and put the fear of God into millions. The Little Big One, Herb Caen called it.

Maybe the best we can do for now is to adopt the transparent approach of John Calipari, the Kentucky coach. He makes no apologies for what he does. He recruits players who plan to turn pro after a year or two and doesn't pretend that he expects them to graduate. In that sense, Calipari is being more honest about college basketball than is the NCAA.

Coyne has continued to vote.
Rauschenberg was widely regarded as a principal bridge between Abstract Expressionism in the 1950s and Pop art in the 1960s, but he did not subscribe to any narrow doctrine. His work also influenced the emergence of Neo-Dada, Minimal, Conceptual, Post-minimal, Process and performance art. His deep and abiding interest in printmaking facilitated a major revival in the medium, and his achievements in lithography were instrumental in the creation of a contemporary market for prints. In Europe, the humble, everyday objects of the Arte Povera ("poor art") movement expanded on his use of cast-off materials retrieved from the trash bin and the attic.

Cities and suburbs offer much more sustenance than dry scrubland -- with little of the risk coyotesonce encountered when ranchers and hunters shot them as a matter of course. Coyotes sleep in hedges and drainages. They migrate along storm channels and miles of Southern California Edison easements. They drink from pools and pet bowls. They prey on cats and small dogs. They eat fallen fruit, dig scraps from compost heaps and raid bird feeders, trash cans and bags of pet food.

It was true even before the Great Recession: The number of startups less than a year old was no higher in the boom year of 2006 than it was 30 years ago, when the economy was much smaller, according to the Census Bureau. And the ones that are launching are hiring fewer people, too.

The documents provide a fuller picture of the NYPD's unapologetic approach to protecting the city from terrorism.

The benefits of direct job creation aren't just transitory. It's well documented that persistent unemployment results in a permanent loss of output and labor productivity.

The Baltimore region not only has a number of outstanding parks and the internationally known Inner Harbor, with its outstanding public walkway, but also a system of protected open space, both public and private, that is arguably more impressive than that in Boston, Chicago and most other major metropolitan areas. Yet, it is not generally recognized, appreciated or marketed as a regional resource. The area to which I refer needs a name; I would call it the Baltimore Greenbelt. A greenbelt is defined by the Webster's dictionary as a belt of parks or farmland around an existing community.
Get life support, stat!: If "Pushing Daisies" was a pleasant surprise, "Private Practice" was the opposite. This "Grey's Anatomy" spin-off came with great expectations, considering it featured a stellar member of the "Grey's" ensemble, Kate Walsh (as Dr. Addison Montgomery). But Addison's adventures as a doc at an L.A. clinic were a conpendium of cliches about Southern Cal. Plus, Dr. Montgomery seemed to have left her chops in Seattle. See for yourself on this first season collection. The writers' strike also called an early halt to this one, so maybe season two will be an improvement. Not rated; 394 min.

Mr. Obama was different. He had that cool name. He was black. He'd never done much that was important, save give some fun speeches, but that was OK; neither had most college students, and that didn't keep them from being special either.

The author's personal engagement with this material gives punch to his conclusion: "Carnegie's presuppositions also point to depressing aspects of the American system, which values success over sincerity, individualism over community. . . . Carnegie just assumes (unconsciously) that he is dealing with a world of pathological narcissists" -- a regrettably apt description of modern America at its worst.

Whenever I get the chance to show love to a Diplomats member — whether it's a lowly alum like Un Kasa or the king of kings himself, Cam'ron — I'm going to do it. This is because the Diplomats (better known as Dipset) will go down as one of the best rap cliques of all time, a distinction that, at least for me, requires no second-guessing. It was the Dips' timeless hits, outsized personalities and the insane Harlem flair they brought to everything they did that made them rap's hottest crew for a few years. Before rappers were yelling "Swag!" every 15 seconds, the Diplomats did it without the tiresome reminding. It was just always there.

One breakdown by Collinsworth I didn’t like was when he questioned S Kenny Phillips on Robinson’s 34-yard touchdown in the third quarter. It was against a Cover-2 look and Phillips had two receivers coming at him. One was WR Miles Austin in the slot, who wasn’t rerouted by Rolle. Phillips had to honor Austin, which is why he was late to get to Robinson. I wouldn’t blame him there. If I had to point to where the coverage could improve, I’d say Rolle could’ve influenced Austin a bit more and CB Corey Webster could’ve sunk deeper and more quickly because there was no threat in the flat. However, it’s also a great throw and catch as well.

My mother recalled hiding in the crowded bunker with frightened mothers and crying children.

In addition to preparing ourselves, we need to prepare our children. It's a difficult conversation to have, and it is one we must learn to undertake. One of the better suggestions I've heard in the wake of the Penn State scandal is that children shouldn't just have one or two parents they feel safe going to for help. They should have five "safe adults," and if one does not help, they can go to the next.
Add complex brightness. Acidity gets the attention of your taste buds, which is why we like things like mustard, pickles and even ketchup. Regular yellow mustard can be brash without being interesting. Try one that brings more to the party. A dijon brings heat, honey mustard brings sweetness, whole grain brings texture. Pickles come in many varieties, too, and try other vegetables pickled like fennel or onions.

If it happens to conflict with this year's constitution, they rewrite it. The United States is the only Western nation in which our rulers invoke the Constitution for the purpose of overriding it – or, at any rate, torturing its language beyond repair.

I'm a little disappointed. Like most Cardinal fans, I would've loved to see Albert finish his career as a Cardinal. But how can anybody criticize a player for doing what's best for him and his family? In the long run, this is probably better for all concerned; like most, I was really worried about how much a huge 10-year contract was going to hamstring the organization going forward. Should make for a real interesting 2012.

"It's never easy to deal with expectations. Anytime you're the team's No. 1 prospect, people expect the world from you. And this game is not that easy," Tulowitzki said. "Pomeranz is not going to go out and win 20 games. Fifteen games is something I think he can do. But that's still a lot on a young kid's plate. We have to give him room to grow and to fail.

This represents a breakthrough in the long-simmering animosity between conservative and liberal Catholics over how much the church should have changed in the wake of Vatican II.

When the clerical sex-abuse scandals surfaced in 2002, conservative Catholics blamed a woozy post-Vatican II mind-set that signaled that anything was permissible, while liberals pointed the finger at a hidebound hierarchy desirous of sweeping unpleasant truths under the rug.

Mayor Bing has talked about achieving that but never acted on it.

This is unlikely to be Iran's last chance to negotiate, but Western officials say the meeting Saturday might provide the leadership's best opportunity to compromise — if it is inclined to. They fear that Iran's leaders will find it even harder to explain a compromise to its people in coming months if tightening sanctions on oil exports, the mainstay of the economy, make it appear that cooperation is a surrender to foreign pressure.

Lohse fed the jam with consecutive walks, the second of which forced in the tying run. With several lefthanded bats available and only righthander Victor Marte warm in the Cardinals bullpen, Roenicke chose to let Estrada hit for himself.

This newish Old Town venture is an ode to simple street dishes from all over Asia. The 500-year fusion of Portuguese and Chinese cultures on the island of Macau finds ecstatic expression in serradura ($6), the Portuguese word for "sawdust." Served in a small soup bowl, the dish begins with a base of cream and sweetened condensed milk whipped together into a surprisingly light pudding. Cocoa powder is dusted on top, and atop that comes a generous layer of the "sawdust" -- pulverized English-style tea biscuits. It's fattening and fabulous.

Then I add in the Golden Globes (knowing they’re a joke, but realizing all the Hollywood hype they create) and the awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (because the industry is so full of, and intimidated by, British talent). I also look at the prizes given out by the industry’s three big professional groups — the Screen Actors Guild, the Writers Guild and the Producers Guild.
What players and coaches said after the Broncos' 49-29 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs at Invesco Field on Sunday.
Those duck confit sandwiches begin with salted legs cooked overnight until tender. When Bittner, 31, mingles earthy meat with her delicate apricot sauce and homemade onions, you taste her feel for balance and nuance. Ham and cheese vaults beyond the ordinary here with lean, flavor-popping meat, sharp gruyere and creamy Oregon butter. But the real find may be the house riff on Spanish bread and chocolate: a toasted baguette oozing dark, melted Scharrfen Berger, the piercing crunch of fleur de sel and a sauve hint of olive oil.
But there is plenty of music in Marley, including exquisite alternative takes of early, essential songs. What also comes across is how, while life in the Marley camp was chaotic and ganja-fogged, he held to his core beliefs. His songs espoused freedom, love, and equality, and so, too, did his actions. Marley became a wealthy man in the last years of his life, but he gave much of his money away - people would queue up at the gates of his Kingston compound, and they would leave with cash.
Long delays should turn even loooonger over the coming weeks as crews start a project to install a new traffic signal system at the highway exit area along the border of Willowick and Wickliffe.

It's my opinion that the public doesn't have the right to hear tapes of 9-1-1 calls, unless approval is first given by the caller or the victim, or is required to be released by authorities in the interest of public safety, or surfaces in a court of law.
details on this story. Is this a case of double-dipping in our pockets? Also, those of us without computers are denied the various TV daily deals. We are the ones who really need them. Is this discrimination or an advertising ploy?
She noted the Food and Drug Administration has said it has prevented more than 100 new shortages in 2011.

That's apparently how too many NBA players feel about playing against World Peace. Talk about someone's who's acted erratically. And needs anger management courses. Remember, he drew that whopping 86-game suspension back in 2004 for his role in the wild brawl in the Palace at Auburn Hills during that Indiana Pacers-Detroit Pistons game. And all told, he's been suspended 13 times for 111 games during his NBA career.

And we know what would happen if Republicans in Congress were allowed to keep holding Richard's nomination hostage. More of our loved ones would be tricked into making bad financial decisions. More dishonest lenders could take advantage of some of the most vulnerable families. And the vast majority of financial firms who do the right thing would be undercut by those who don't.
However, career counseling can lower those numbers. In fact, it's not a bad idea to start looking at career options as early as your junior or senior year in high school. Check with your guidance counselor about career assessment tools and job shadowing opportunities that can help you narrow your degree focus before you even set foot on a college campus. And, when you get to campus be sure to engage the services of the university's career counseling staff.

Its registered voters make up just 2.2 percent of the 10-county region, less than any other county. There’s a stopgap in place, however, with the regional roundtable, which will craft the final project list. Each county, no matter the size, gets two votes (except Fulton, where the Atlanta mayor also gets a vote). So Rockdale with 49,266 voters gets two votes on the roundtable, just like Gwinnett with 386,419 voters.
"Many Latinos use folk healers because other health care is not readily available," says Alberto Moreno, migrant health coordinator for the state Department of Health and Human Services. "The Western medical system is often the last resort for our community, it's so cost-prohibitive."

A: Oh yeah, absolutely. I'm not worried about results so much anymore. I was going through that slump there for a while and worrying about results and pressing and wanting to stay in the lineup and thinking I could only stay in the lineup if I could hit. All that negative thought process just buries you even more. I quit worrying about that about a week ago and the results came. I got a few hits in a game, a few RBIs and stuff. In the grand scheme of things looking back, I don't even worry about that anymore. The numbers are going to be what they are at the end of the year. They're not going to be terrible, they're not going to be the best in the league. I'm not worrying about it, I'm just trying to get a routine down and stick with it.

Peer-reviewed studies find that people who avoid meat cut their risk of obesity, diabetes and heart disease -- the No. 1 cause of death in America. Researchers have found that low-fat, plant-based diets can even help reverse type 2 diabetes and heart disease after these diseases have already set in.
In general, low-budget films stand to benefit the most proportionately by winning because they have received less hype and exposure, the report said. Last year’s winner, "The Hurt Locker," reaped $17 million in box office receipts and cost just $11 million to make. "Slumdog Millionaire," the winner from 2009, raked in $54 million after its Oscar nomination, nearly four times its budget.
Democrats say the overt signs of unity between the Clintons and Obama put the president at a distinct advantage over Romney.

The Knicks could have brought their best game to Miami, but they still would have lost Game 2, because they are hopelessly overmatched. The Heaters were sharp Monday night. They moved the ball brilliantly. Dwyane Wade had his legs, that flubbed dunk notwithstanding. Mario Chalmers hit game-busters. Chris Bosh was remarkably efficient. LeBron James had an And-One party.

Mr. Rodricks also notes the Social Security contributions and taxes illegal aliens pay and subsequently don't collect. Since they are working in low-paying jobs, I doubt much money goes into the U.S. Treasury. However, all the illegal immigrants attending our schools and using enormous resources from welfare to medical care are never mentioned. Just ask the governor ofCalifornia.
So we knew. Meat is bad.
SHEA McCLELLIN: ‘‘Marginal weight-room strength - managed only 19 reps of 225 pounds on the bench press at the Combine.

Questionable Calls: Kendricks was a worthy pick, but his short stature may not be ideal to playing as a SAM linebacker that often has to cover much taller tight ends. Foles had been sliding down draft boards and may have been still available on the third day, while the Eagles didn't bring in an understudy to heavily worked running back LeSean McCoy until taking the underachieving Brown near the end of the event.

We talk about them in terms of micrometers in size, or a millionth of a meter. They are typically discussed in the context of what you can breathe or inhale. There are particles of less than 10 microns in size and diameter (PM10), which are inhalable. But those are considered coarse and pretty big particles in terms of what you can breathe in.

With a statewide unemployment rate hovering just south of 10 percent, our state's leaders need to regain focus at this critical time. Arizona has to get back to work. When we should be debating the best path to economic growth, we've instead been left to contemplate canceled conventions and wrongheaded boycotts.

The 5.5 percent interest rate Key pays on the loan costs the bank $31 million per quarter. Plus, it can't acquire other banks or boost its dividend while it's still on the hook for TARP.
